# Leukemia

Introduction

The development of most types of leukemia increases with age, also different types of leukemia have different types of risk factors involved. In this project we have discussed the problem of finding the right research paper for a particular topic. Our topic is Leukemia and its subtypes(AML,ALL,CML,CLL). When we were trying to find articles related to leukemia there were many other papers being displayed in the search result. For the dataset we have downloaded abstracts for each type of leukemia and converted the TXT format files into XML format with help of Mendeley and structured our own dataset. Our aim here is to develop a model that automatically classifies the abstracts of the literature into one of the leukemia related categories using machine learning method when they are entered. Such a model would allow people to search the literature more efficiently and improve the accuracy of the search.
