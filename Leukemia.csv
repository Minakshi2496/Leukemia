Data Sources: A literature search of articles published between January 1966 and June 2013 was performed using PubMed with the following search terms: ponatinib, AP24534, and Iclusig. ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc, was contacted for unpublished information. Other sources included American Society of Hematology abstracts, the Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Web site, and clinicaltrials.gov. Study Selection&#x2F;Data Extraction: Included articles and abstracts were published in English and contain information about ponatinib, particularly in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Data Synthesis: Following the phase II PACE trial, ponatinib was approved for the treatment of patients with chronic-phase (CP), accelerated-phase (AP), or blast-phase (BP) CML or Ph+ ALL who have become intolerant or resistant to previous therapy. Unlike other BCR-ABL TKIs, ponatinib was designed to overcome the T315I mutation. At 15.3 months, 46% of patients with CP-CML achieved a complete cytogenetic response, and 34% achieved a major molecular response. Complete hematologic responses occurred in 47% of patients with AP-CML, 21% with BP-CML, and 34% with Ph+ ALL after 1 year. Severe toxicities included myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and arterial thrombosis. Conclusions: Ponatinib is a potent TKI that can overcome several resistance mechanisms in previously treated patients with CML and Ph+ ALL. Ponatinib should be reserved for patients who have failed first-line therapy, have the T315I mutation, or have progressed. © The Author(s) 2013.",Annals of Pharmacotherapy,1

It catalyzes the hydrolysis of amino acid L-asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia, which leads to cell death. Clinical trials have been conducted using L-ASNase in combination with other drugs and radiotherapy, which have led to great success in the treatment of ALL. Treatments consist of induction therapy and central nervous system therapy. The achievement of complete remission in patients is associated with a few side-effects of using L-asparaginase, including pancreatitis, coagulation abnormalities and allergic reactions. Sometimes tumor cells may develop resistance to L-ASNase. To overcome these difficulties, the drug is modified by pegylation or immobilization, and also treatment protocols can be modified to increase the efficiency of the drug. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.",Leukemia and Lymphoma,4

The therapeutic efficacy (e.g., chemoresistance) and adverse effects of asparaginase (e.g., hypersensivity and pancreatitis) have been investigated over the past four decades. It was suggested early on that leukemic cells are resistant to asparaginase because of their increased asparagine synthetase activity. Afterward, other mechanisms associated with asparaginase resistance were reported. Not only leukemic cells but also patients themselves may play a role in causing asparaginase resistance, which has been associated with unfavorable outcome in children with ALL.

Despite this success, hypersensitivity remains a significant problem, often requiring the termination of asparaginase. Failure to complete the entire asparaginase therapy course due to clinical hypersensitivity, subclinical hypersensitivity (i.e., silent inactivation), or other treatment-related toxicity is associated with poor ALL outcomes. Thus, it is critical to rapidly identify patients who develop clinical&#x2F;subclinical hypersensitivity and switch these patients to an alternate asparaginase formulation.

High throughput genomic technologies have the potential to revolutionize cancer care in this era of personalized medicine. Using such advanced technologies, we and others have shown that a diverse assortment of cooperative genetic and epigenetic events drive the resistant phenotype.

The last decade has witnessed a transformation in our understanding of the genetic basis of ALL due to detailed integrative genomic profiling of large cohorts of childhood ALL. Initially using microarray based approaches, and more recently with next-generation sequencing, these studies have enabled more precise subclassification of ALL, and have shown that each ALL entity is characterized by constellations of structural and sequence mutations that typically perturb key cellular pathways including lymphoid development, cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, Ras- and tyrosine kinase-driven signaling, and epigenetic regulation. Importantly, several of the newly identified genetic alterations have entered the clinic to improve diagnosis and risk stratification, and are being pursued as new targets for therapeutic intervention. Studies of ALL have also led the way in dissecting the subclonal heterogeneity of cancer, and have shown that individual patients commonly harbor multiple related but genetically distinct subclones, and that this genetically determined clonal heterogeneity is an important determinant of relapse. In addition, genome-wide profiling has identified inherited genetic variants that influence ALL risk. Ongoing studies are deploying detailed integrative genetic transcriptomic and epigenetic sequencing to comprehensively define the genomic landscape of ALL.

Despite improved remissionrates, current treatment regimens for pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia are often associated withadverse effects and central nervous system relapse, necessitating more effective and safer agents. Bafilomycin A1is an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase that is frequently used at high concentration to block late-phase autophagy.Here, we show that bafilomycin A1 at a low concentration (1 nM) effectively and specifically inhibited and killedpediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. It targeted both early and late stages of the autophagy pathwayby activating mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and by disassociating the Beclin 1-Vps34 complex, as wellas by inhibiting the formation of autolysosomes, all of which attenuated functional autophagy. Bafilomycin A1also targeted mitochondria and induced caspase-independent apoptosis by inducing the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to the nucleus. Moreover, bafilomycin A1 induced the binding of Beclin 1to Bcl-2, which further inhibited autophagy and promoted apoptotic cell death. In primary cells from pediatricpatients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a xenograft model, bafilomycin A1 specifically targetedleukemia cells while sparing normal cells. An in vivo mouse toxicity assay confirmed that bafilomycin A1 is safe.Our data thus suggest that bafilomycin A1 is a promising candidate drug for the treatment of pediatric B-cell acutelymphoblastic leukemia.",Haematologica,12

This disease not only affects adult but also is a common cancer type among children. Treatment of leukaemia depends on its type and how far the disease has spread in the body. Leukaemia is classified into two types depending on how rapidly it grows: acute and chronic leukaemia. The early diagnosis of this disease is vital for effective treatment and recovery. This paper presents an automated diagnostic system to detect acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The model uses labeled microscopic blood smear images to detect the malignant leukaemia cells. The current work uses data obtained from the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Image DataBase (ALL_IDB) and performs various data augmentation techniques to increase the number of training data which in effect reduces the over-training problem. The model has been trained on 515 images using a fivefold validation technique achieving an accuracy of 95.54% and further tested on the remaining 221 images achieving almost 100% accuracy during most of the trials, maintaining an average of 99.5% accuracy. The method does not need any pre-processing or segmentation technique and works efficiently on raw data. This method can, hence, prove profitable for pathologist in diagnosing ALL efficiently.

The analysis of white blood cells (WBCs) permits us to detect the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a type of blood cancer that causes fatality when untreated. At present, the morphological analysis of blood cells is performed manually by skilled operators, which holds numerous drawbacks. The manual techniques for leukemia detection are time-consuming and show less accurate results. Hence, there is a need for an automatic method for detecting leukemia. In order to overcome the demerits associated with the manual methods of counting and classifying, an automatic method of blast cell counting and leukemia classification is progressed. This paper proposes a leukemia detection method, using the Gini index–based Fuzzy Naive Bayes (GFNB) classifier that is the integration of Gini index and Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier. Initially, the input multi-cell blood smear image is subjected to pre-processing, and the blast cell is segmented using the adaptive thresholding. Then, the blast cells are counted using the proposed classifier so as to decide the presence of leukemia for the effective diagnosis. Experimental analysis using the ALL-IDB1 database confirms that the proposed method operates better than the existing methods in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity that are found to be 0.9591, 0.9599, and 1, respectively. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is reliable and accurate. Also, the proposed system can help the physicians to improve and speed up their process.

Fifty pediatric patients (n &#x3D; 50) included who were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Clinical variables comprised of the blood biochemistry (CBC, LFTs, RFTs) results, and distribution of type of ALL, i.e., T ALL or B ALL. Phenotypic data included the age, sex of the child, and consanguinity, while environmental factors included the habitat, socioeconomic status, and access to filtered drinking water. Fifteen different features&#x2F;attributes were collected for each case individually. To retrieve most useful discriminating attributes, four different supervised ML algorithms were used including classification and regression trees (CART), random forest (RM), gradient boosted machine (GM), and C5.0 decision tree algorithm. To determine the accuracy of the derived CART algorithm on future data, a ten-fold cross validation was performed on the present data set. The ALL was common in children of age below 5 years in male patients whole belonged to middle class family of rural areas. (B-ALL) was most frequent as compared with T-ALL. The consanguinity was present in 54% of cases. Low levels of platelets and hemoglobin and high levels of white blood cells were reported in child ALL patients. CART provided the best and complete fit for the entire data set yielding a 99.83% model fit accuracy, and a misclassification of 0.17% on the entire sample space, while C5.0 reported 98.6%, random forest 94.44%, and gradient boosted machine resulted in 95.61% fitting. The variable importance of each primary discriminating attribute is platelet 43%, hemoglobin 24%, white blood cells 4%, and sex of the child 4%. An overall accuracy of 87.4% was recorded for the classifier. Platelet count abnormality can be considered as a major factor in predicting pediatric ALL.

Though hyperglycemia in ALL patients is usually transient, it may be associated with adverse health outcomes. However, the risk factors for and consequences of hyperglycemia are poorly understood. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia significant enough to require insulin therapy during induction chemotherapy would be associated with increased morbidity and mortality in pediatric ALL patients during induction chemotherapy and in subsequent care. Methods: We abstracted clinical and resource utilization data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database utilizing ICD-9 codes and medication charges. We used logistic regression analysis to predict the development of hyperglycemia. The effects of hyperglycemia on binary and count adverse outcomes following induction chemotherapy were modeled using mixed-effect regression models. Results: An increased risk of hyperglycemia requiring insulin was associated with older age, female sex, higher risk group and trisomy 21. Patients on insulin for hyperglycemia had increased mortality following induction chemotherapy. These patients were more likely to have subsequent infectious complications, need for bone marrow transplant, and risk of disease relapse. They also had greater length of inpatient stay, higher cost of care, and were more likely to require intensive care unit admission during induction chemotherapy. Conclusions: Hyperglycemia requiring insulin during induction chemotherapy in pediatric ALL is associated with an increased risk of short-term and long-term complications.

However, with most data being derived from case-control study interviews, information on the underpinning reasons for caesarean section is sparse, and evidence is conflicting. Objectives: Use clinical records compiled at the time of delivery to investigate the association between childhood ALL and caesarean delivery; examining timing in relation to labour onset, and reasons for the procedure. Methods: Data are from the UK Childhood Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study conducted in the 1990s, when caesarean section rates were relatively low, in England, Scotland, and Wales. Children with ALL were individually matched to two controls on sex, date of birth, and region of residence. Information on mode of delivery and complications was abstracted from obstetric records. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression models adjusted for matching variables and relevant covariates. Results: Around 75% of the 1034 cases and 1914 controls were born through unassisted vaginal delivery. Caesarean delivery was as frequent in cases and controls (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.84, 1.36). No association was observed between ALL and caesarean delivery either during or before labour, with adjusted ORs of 1.08 (95% CI 0.78, 1.48) and 1.09 (95% CI 0.78, 1.53), respectively. For B-cell ALL, the ORs were 1.14 (95% CI 0.81, 1.59) for caesarean during labour and 1.21 (95% CI 0.85, 1.72) for prelabour. The underpinning reasons for caesarean delivery differed between cases and controls; with preeclampsia, although very rare, being more common amongst cases born by caesarean (OR 8.91, 95% CI 1.48, 53.42).

The haematologist suffers a lot to discriminate the presence of leukaemia in the patients using the blood smears. To overcome the inaccuracy and reliability issues, this paper proposes an automatic method of leukaemia detection, named chronological Sine Cosine Algorithm–based actor-critic neural network (Chrono-SCA-ACNN). Initially, the blood smear images are segmented using the proposed entropy-based hybrid model, from which the image-level features and statistical features are extracted from the segments. Then, the selected features are applied to the proposed classifier, which detects the leukaemia. In the proposed Chrono-SCA-ACNN, the optimal weights are selected by the proposed Chrono-SCA, which is the integration of the chronological concept in the SCA. Finally, the experimentation is performed using the ALL-IDB2 database, and the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing methods is evaluated. From the analysis, the accuracy of the proposed method is found to be 0.99, which proves that it outperforms the existing classification methodologies.

In the current study, the authors evaluated the prevalence and risk factors of diabetes mellitus among clinically assessed adult survivors of childhood ALL. Methods: The authors performed a retrospective evaluation of data from survivors of ALL and community controls who were enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study between October 1, 2007, and June 30, 2016. Participants were adults with ≥10 years of survival of childhood ALL and community controls who completed clinical and laboratory evaluations. Data for the current analysis were abstracted from medical records. Exposures evaluated herein included chemotherapy and radiation exposures and medical history, including drug-induced diabetes mellitus. Results: Of 1360 eligible adults who were ≥10-year survivors of childhood ALL, a total of 1044 completed the evaluations; these individuals had a mean age of 33.97±9.14 years and 50.86% were male. The 368 controls, 45.65% of whom were male, had a mean age of 35.33±10.21 years. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was found in approximately 7.47% of survivors and 3.80% of controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.11-3.87).

In recent years, many literature report that multiple abnormally expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) can participate in the development of T-ALL by regulating the PI3K&#x2F;AKT signaling pathway. For example, overexpression of miR-19 and miR181a can activate the PI3K&#x2F;AKT signaling pathway, which leads to the development of T-ALL and induction of chemotherapy drug resistance, as well as the low expression of miR-26b and miR-29a. Apart from the inhibitors and traditional Chinese medicines that target the PI3K&#x2F;AKT signaling pathway, regulation of the expression of the corresponding miRNA may also be a potential treatment protocol for T-ALL.

Segmentation of the blood smear cells and extraction of features of the cells is essential in the field of medicine. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a form of blood cancer caused due to the abnormal increase in the production of immature white blood cells in the bone marrow. It mostly affects the children below 5 years and adults above 50 years of age. Due to the late diagnosis and cost of the devices used for the determination, the mortality rate has increased drastically. Flow cytometry technique that performs automated counting fails to identify the abnormal cells. Manual recount performed using hemocytometer are prone to errors and are imprecise. The proposed work aims to survey different computer-aided system techniques used to segment the blood smear image. The primary objective here is to derive knowledge from the different methodologies used for extracting features from white blood cells and develop a system that would accurately segment the blood smear image by overcoming the drawbacks of the previous works. The objective mentioned above is achieved in two ways. Firstly, a novel algorithm is developed to segment the nucleus and cytoplasm of white blood cell. Secondly, a model is built to extract the features and train the model. The different supervised classifiers are compared, and the one with the highest accuracy is used for the classification. Six hundred images are used in the experimentation. InfoGainAttributeEval and the Ranker Search method are used to achieve the feature selection which in turn helps in improvising the classifier performance. The result shows the classification of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia into its three respective categories namely: ALL-L1, ALL-L2, ALL-L3. The model can differentiate between a normal peripheral blood smear and an abnormal blood smear. The extracted feature values of a cancerous cell and a normal cell are also shown. The performance of the model is evaluated using the test images stained with various stains. The proposed algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 98.6%. The promising results show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool by the pathologists. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing,28

A total of 23 articles and abstracts, most published between 2012 and 2016, were identified for inclusion in the primary meta-analysis. Typically, patients were in their first complete remission at the time of minimal residual disease assessment; in two studies, all patients were in their second, or later, complete remission. The primary analysis revealed improved relapsefree survival across all studies for patients who achieved minimal residual disease negativity (random effects hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.91-2.86). Improved overall survival for patients who achieved minimal residual disease negativity was also observed (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-2.94). There was no observed difference in the impact of minimal residual disease status in subgroups based on disease stage, minimal residual disease sensitivity threshold level, Philadelphia chromosome status, histological phenotype, risk group, minimal residual disease testing location, minimal residual disease timing after induction, or minimal residual disease detection method.

Several adult centers recently adopted pediatric protocols. Whether this has narrowed LOC disparities in real–world settings is unknown. Methods: The IMPACT Cohort is an Ontario population–based cohort that captured demographic, disease and treatment (treatment protocol, chemotherapy doses) data for all 15-21 year olds diagnosed with ALL 1992-2011. Cancer outcomes were determined by chart abstraction and linkage to provincial healthcare databases. Treatment protocols were classified as pediatric- or adult-based. We examined predictors of outcome, including LOC, protocol, disease biology, and time period. Results: Of 271 patients, 152 (56%) received therapy at adult centers. 5-year event-free survival (EFS ± SE) among AYA at pediatric vs adult centers was 72% ± 4% vs 56% ± 4% (P &#x3D; 0.03); 5-year overall survival (OS) was 82% ± 4% vs 64% ± 4% (P &lt; 0.001).

Recent preclinical studies suggest that dasatinib may be a candidate therapy in additional ALL subtypes including pre-BCRþ ALL. Here we utilized shRNA library screening and global transcriptomic analysis to identify several novel genes and pathways that may enhance dasatinib efficacy or mitigate potential resistance in human pre-BCRþ ALL. Depletion of the transcriptional coactivator CBP increased dasatinib sensitivity by downregulating transcription of the pre-BCR signaling pathway previously associated with dasatinib sensitivity. Acquired resistance was due, in part, to upregulation of alternative pathways including WNT through a mechanism, suggesting transcriptional plasticity. Small molecules that disrupt CBP interactions with the CREB KID domain or b-catenin showed promising preclinical efficacy in combination with dasatinib. These findings highlight novel modulators of sensitivity to targeted therapies in human pre-BCRþ ALL, which can be reversed by small-molecule inhibitors. They also identify promising therapeutic approaches to ameliorate dasatinib sensitivity and prevent resistance in ALL. Significance: These findings reveal mechanisms that modulate sensitivity to dasatinib and suggest therapeutic strategies to improve the outcome of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Cancer Research,31

Using national data for Australia, we describe (i) the number and type of treatment centers caring for AYAs, (ii) induction&#x2F;first-line treatments, and (iii) survival outcomes. Procedure: National population-based study assessing treatment of 15- to 24-year-olds diagnosed with ALL or AML between 2007 and 2012. Treatment details were abstracted from hospital medical records. Treatment centers were classified as pediatric or adult (adult AYA-focused or other adult; and by AYA volume [high&#x2F;low]). Cox proportional hazard regression analyses examined associations between treatment and overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival outcomes. Results: Forty-seven hospitals delivered induction therapy to 351 patients (181 ALL and 170 AML), with 74 (21%) treated at pediatric centers; 70% of hospitals treated less than two AYA leukemia patients per year. Regardless of treatment center, 82% of ALL patients were on pediatric protocols. For AML, pediatric protocols were not used in adult centers, with adult centers using a non-COG 7+3-type induction protocol (51%, where COG is Cooperative Oncology Group) or an ICE-type protocol (39%, where ICE is idarubicin, cytarabine, etoposide). Exploratory analyses suggested that for both ALL and AML, AYAs selected for adult protocols have worse overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival outcomes. Conclusions: Pediatric protocols were commonly used for ALL patients regardless of where they are treated, indicating rapid assimilation of recent evidence by Australian hematologists. For AML, pediatric protocols were only used at pediatric centers. Further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal treatment approach for AYA AML patients.",Pediatric Blood and Cancer,34

Assessing the association of MRD status following induction therapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with relapse and mortality may improve the efficiency of clinical trials and accelerate drug development. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the relationships between event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) with MRD status in pediatric and adult ALL using publications of clinical trials and other databases. DATA SOURCES: Clinical studies in ALL identified via searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, and clinicaltrials.gov. STUDY SELECTION: Our search and study screening process adhered to the PRISMA Guidelines. Studies that addressed EFS or OS by MRD status in patients with ALL were included; reviews, abstracts, and studies with fewer than 30 patients or insufficient MRD description were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study sample size, patient age, follow-up time, timing of MRD assessment (postinduction or consolidation), MRD detection method, phenotype&#x2F;genotype (B cell, T cell, Philadelphia chromosome), and EFS and OS. Searches of PubMed and MEDLINE identified 566 articles. A parallel search on clinicaltrials.gov found 67 closed trials and 62 open trials as of 2014. Merging results of 2 independent searches and applying exclusions gave 39 publications in 3 arms of patient populations (adult, pediatric, and mixed). We performed separate meta-analyses for each of these 3 subpopulations. RESULTS: The 39 publications comprised 13 637 patients: 16 adult studies (2076 patients), 20 pediatric (11 249 patients), and 3 mixed (312 patients). The EFS hazard ratio (HR) for achieving MRD negativity is 0.23 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0.18-0.28) for pediatric patients and 0.28 (95% BCI, 0.24-0.33) for adults. The respective HRs in OS are 0.28 (95% BCI, 0.19-0.41) and 0.28 (95% BCI, 0.20-0.39). The effect was similar across all subgroups and covariates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The value of having achieved MRD negativity is substantial in both pediatric and adult patients with ALL. These results are consistent across therapies, methods of and times of MRD assessment, cutoff levels, and disease subtypes. Minimal residual disease status warrants consideration as an early measure of disease response for evaluating new therapies, improving the efficiency of clinical trials, accelerating drug development, and for regulatory approval. A caveat is that an accelerated approval of a particular new drug using an intermediate end point, such as MRD, would require confirmation using traditional efficacy end points.",JAMA Oncology,37

Recent discoveries by high resolution genomic technologies have characterized the biology of relapsed leukemia, most notably pathways leading to the drug resistant phenotype. These observations open the possibility of targeting such pathways to prevent and&#x2F;or treat relapse. Likewise, early experiences with new immunotherapeutic approaches have shown great promise. Areas covered: We performed a literature search on PubMed and recent meeting abstracts using the keywords below. We focused on the biology and clonal evolution of relapsed disease highlighting potential new targets of therapy. We further summarized the results of early trials of the three most prominent immunotherapy agents currently under investigation. Expert commentary: Discovery of targetable pathways that lead to drug resistance and recent breakthroughs in immunotherapy show great promise towards treating this aggressive disease. The best way to treat relapse, however, is to prevent it which makes incorporation of these new approaches into frontline therapy the best approach. Challenges remain to balance efficacy with toxicity and to prevent the emergence of resistant subclones which is why combining these newer agents with conventional chemotherapy will likely become standard of care.",Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy,38

To the best of our knowledge, whether adult oncologists in the United States have adopted this approach to ALL in AYA patients is currently unknown. The objective of the current study was to provide a population-based description of ALL treatment patterns in AYA individuals over the past decade. METHODS: Data regarding AYA patients aged 15 to 39 years and diagnosed with ALL between 2004 and 2014 while living in the Greater Bay Area were obtained from the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry (GBACR). Treating facilities were designated as pediatric or adult centers; induction treatment regimens were abstracted from registry text data fields. RESULTS: Of 304 patients diagnosed in the GBACR catchment region, complete treatment data were available for 229 (75%). The location of care was identified for 296 patients (97%) treated at 31 unique centers. Approximately 70% of AYA patients received induction therapy at an adult treatment center. All AYA patients who were treated at pediatric centers received pediatric ALL regimens. Among AYA patients treated by adult oncologists with complete treatment data, none received a pediatric regimen before 2008. Between 2008 and 2012, while the US Adult Intergroup C10403 pediatric-inspired ALL protocol was open to accrual, 31% of AYA patients treated by adult oncologists received pediatric regimens. This rate fell to 21% from 2013 through 2014. Adult facilities treating ≥ 2 AYA patients with ALL per year captured in the GBACR were more likely to administer pediatric regimens than lower volume centers (P &#x3D;.03).

In utero and early life exposures to air toxics such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene, which are known leukemogens in adults, may play an etiologic role in childhood leukemia that comprises the majority of pediatric cancers. We conducted a population based case-control study to examine individual effects of benzene, 1,3-butadiene and polycyclic organic matter (POM) in ambient residential air on acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed in children under age 5 years in Texas from 1995-2011. Methods: Texas Cancer Registry cases were linked to birth records and then were frequency matched by birth month and year to 10 population-based controls. Maternal and infant characteristics from birth certificates were abstracted to obtain information about potential confounders. Modelled estimates of benzene, 1,3-butadiene and POM exposures at the census tract level were assigned by linking geocoded maternal addresses from birth certificates to U.S. EPA National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment data for single and co-pollutant statistical analyses. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were applied to evaluate associations between air toxics and childhood leukemia. Results: In adjusted single pollutant models, odds of childhood leukemia among mothers with the highest ambient air exposures compared to those in the lowest quartile were 1.11 (95 % CI: 0.94-1.32) for POM, 1.17 (95 % CI: 0.98-1.39) for benzene and 1.29 (95 % CI: 1.08-1.52) for 1,3-butadiene. In co-pollutant models, odds ratios for childhood leukemia remained elevated for 1,3-butadiene but were close to the null value for benzene and POM. Conclusions: We observed positive associations between 1,3-butadiene and childhood leukemia in single and co-pollutant models whereas effect estimates from single pollutant models were diminished for benzene and POM in co-pollutant models. Early life exposure to 1,3-butadiene rather than benzene or POM appears to increase early childhood risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia.",Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source,41

Identification of prognostic factors that allow risk stratification and tailored treatment have improved overall survival. However, nearly a quarter of patients considered standard risk on the basis of conventional prognostic factors still relapse, and relapse is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Relapse is thought to result from extremely low levels of leukemic cells left over once complete remission is reached, termed minimal residual disease (MRD). Poor event-free survival (EFS) as well as overall survival for those who are classified as MRD-positive have been substantiated in seminal studies demonstrating the prognostic value of MRD for EFS in the past few decades. This review sought to further elucidate the relationship between MRD and EFS by looking at relapse, the primary determinant of EFS and the biological mechanism through which MRD is thought to act. This evidence review aimed to ascertain whether MRD is an independent prognostic factor for relapse and to assess the effect of MRD-directed treatment on patient-important outcomes in childhood ALL. METHODS: Large prospective cohort studies with a priori multivariable analysis that includes potential confounders are required to draw confirmatory conclusions about the independence of a prognostic factor. Data on the prognostic value of MRD for relapse measured by molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor rearrangements) or flow cytometry for leukemia-associated immunophenotypes or difference-from-normal approach were abstracted from included studies. Relevant data on relapse, EFS, and overall survival were abstracted from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of MRD-directed treatment. RESULTS: A total of 2,832 citations were reviewed, of which 12 studies were included in this review. All cohort studies evaluating MRD as a prognostic factor for relapse found significant independent value when added to various existing prognostic factors. Seven studies showed prognostic value of MRD measured at the end of induction therapy and two at the end of consolidation therapy in de novo ALL, one study in relapsed ALL after re-induction therapy, and three studies before hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

ALL,"Brethon, Benoît, Cavé, Hélène, Fahd, Mony, Baruchel, André",Infant acute leukemia,2016,10.1016&#x2F;j.bulcan.2015.11.009,"If acute leukemia is the most frequent cancer in childhood (33%), it remains a very rare diagnosis in infants less than one year old, e.g. less than 5% of cases. At this age, the frequency of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (almost all of B-lineage) is quite similar to the one of myeloblastic forms (AML). Infant leukemia frequently presents with high hyperleucocytosis, major tumoral burden and numerous extra-hematological features, especially in central nervous system and skin. Whatever the lineage, the leukemic cell is often very immature cytologically and immunologically. Rearrangements of the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene, located on band 11q23, are the hallmark of these immature leukemias and confer a particular resistance to conventional approaches, corticosteroids and chemotherapy. The immaturity of infants less than 1-year-old is associated to a decrease of the tolerable dose-intensity of some drugs (anthracyclines, alkylating agents) or asks questions about some procedures like radiotherapy or high dose conditioning regimen, responsible of inacceptable acute and late toxicities. The high level of severe infectious diseases and other high-grade side effects limits also the capacity to cure these infants. The survival of infants less than 1-year-old with AML is only 50% but similar to older children. On the other hand, survival of those with ALL is the same, then quite limited comparing the 80% survival in children over one year. Allogeneic stem cell transplantations are indicated in high-risk subgroups of infant ALL (age below 6 months, high hyperleucocytosis &gt; 300.109&#x2F;L, MLL-rearrangement, initial poor prednisone response). However, morbidity and mortality remain very important and these approaches cannot be extended to all cases. During the neonatal period, the dismal prognosis linked to the high number of primary failures or very early relapses and uncertainties about the late toxicities question physicians about ethics.

Methods: This article gives an overview of the currently available options and the clinical approach to the diagnostics and therapy of acute leukemia. Results: The standardization as well as improvements in diagnostic procedures, in particular by immunocytological and genetic procedures, allow a more rapid determination of the exact diagnosis. In addition to age and performance status of patients, an established panel of cytogenetic and molecular markers allows an individual risk stratification for selecting the most appropriate therapeutic procedure for each patient. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger patients with genetically determined intermediate and poor risk status benefit from allogeneic stem cell transplantation whereas patients in the low risk group are still primarily treated with conventional induction chemotherapy with anthracycline and cytarabine. The poor prognosis of elderly patients with AML has been improved by the development of stem cell transplantation procedures with reduced intensity conditioning and for patients not suitable for stem cell transplantation, the introduction of less toxic demethylating substances allows a substantial improvement in outcome and quality of life compared to cytoreductive therapy alone. The additional role of targeted therapies in AML is still under investigation. In adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the standard systemic therapy still consists of complex cytotoxic regimens which have been modified from pediatric protocols. Biologically and genetically determined subgroups of ALL patients as well as poor responders, who can be identified by the detection of significant molecular determined residual disease (MRD) after standard therapy, benefit from allogeneic transplantation in first remission. In patients with bcr-abl positive ALL, the implementation of first and second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors has led to rapidly rising response rates and less toxicity. Patients with relapsed ALL may benefit from new molecular options, e.g. bispecific antibodies. Additionally, improved standardization and supportive care, particularly due to the introduction of modern antimycotic agents, increase the treatment options and improve the prognosis of patients with acute leukemia. Conclusion: The improved diagnostic and therapeutic options for patients with acute leukemia require a complex management. Currently only subgroups of patients benefit from molecular targeted therapeutic strategies. Due to this increasing complexity in the management, patients with acute leukemia should be treated in academic centers and within clinical trials.",Pathologe,45

Indeed, a large body of evidence suggests that proliferation, survival and drug resistance of AML are sustained and modulated by the bone marrow immunosuppressive microenvironment, where both innate and adaptive immune responses are profoundly deregulated. Furthermore, the presence of a number of different immunosuppressive mechanisms results in massive immune deregulation, which causes the eventual escape from natural immune control. Modulating the immune system, as documented by 40 years of stem cell transplantation, may improve survival of AML patients, as the immune system is clearly able to recognize and attack leukemic cells. The understanding of the factors responsible for the escape from immune destruction in AML, which becomes more prominent with disease progression, is necessary for the development of innovative immunotherapeutic treatment modalities in AML.",Expert Review of Hematology,52

Pancytopenia, caused by bone marrow substitution with leukemic cells, impairs maternal and fetal health. Chemotherapeutic agents required to be immediately used to save the mother&#39;s life are likely to adversely affect fetal development and outcome, especially if administered at an early gestational stage. Patients diagnosed with acute leukemia during the first trimester are, therefore, recommended to undergo pregnancy termination. At later gestational stages, antileukemic therapy can be administered, although in this case, fetal outcome is still associated with increased incidence of growth restriction and loss. Special attention to the issue of future reproduction, adopting a personalized fertility preservation approach, is required. This article addresses these subjects, presenting women diagnosed with acute myeloid and acute promyelocytic leukemia in pregnancy.

Although great advances have been made in understanding the role of these mutated genes in AML disease pathogenesis, to date relatively few have been demonstrated to have direct clinical relevance. Recent findings Genomic techniques have allowed for the identification of many mutated genes that appear to drive disease pathogenesis and prognosis in AML. Integrated analyses examining the co-occurrence of these genes in well annotated AML patient cohorts has helped to significantly refine prognostic models, allowing for a more nuanced selection of patients for optimal postremission therapies. Furthermore, there are emerging data that gene mutations may be useful to select patients for optimal doses and&#x2F;or modalities of upfront AML therapy. Finally, mutated genes themselves hold promise as therapeutic targets, as supported by strong preclinical studies.

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, which is available for a minority of patients, efficiently prevents recurrences of leukemia by inducing immune-mediated elimination of leukemic cells, and over the past decades, numerous immunotherapeutic protocols have been developed aiming to mimic the graft-versus-leukemia reaction for the prevention of relapse. Here we review past and present strategies for relapse control with focus on overcoming leukemia-related immunosuppression in AML. We envisage future treatment protocols, in which systemic immune activators, such as vaccines, dendritic cell-based therapies, engineered variants of IL-2, or IL-15, are combined with agents that counter immunosuppression mediated by, e.g., the PD&#x2F;PDL interaction, CTLA-4, CD200, reactive oxygen species, IDO expression, CXCR4, or the KIR&#x2F;class I interaction, based on characteristics of the prevailing malignant clone.

Post-MPN AML usually occurs years after the initial MPN diagnosis with an average age of onset between 64 and 68 years. Chromosome abnormalities are common and many patients have cytogenetic changes that are associated with poor risk features. Post-MPN AML is characterized by acquired somatic gene mutations, but, interestingly, mutations thought to have an etiologic role in the MPN, such as JAK2V617F, are sometimes absent in the AML clone. Conventional AML-style treatment appears to have limited efficacy, although when coupled to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, some patients have long-term survival.

The treatment of AML has advanced little in the past thirty years, in part because of the biologic heterogeneity of the disease and the difficulty in targeting AML cells while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Advances in preventing and treating AML are likely to occur once the cellular and molecular differences between leukemia and normal hematopoietic cells are better understood. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), while, in contrast, a subset of AMLs are lacking this activity. This difference may be relevant to the development of AML and may also provide a better avenue for treating this disease. In this review, we summarize what is known about the ALDHs in normal HSCs and AML and propose strategies for capitalizing on these differences in the treatment of acute leukemia, and possibly other cancers as well. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,61

This study sought to determine the accuracy of AE reporting for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia clinical trials and to test whether an external electronic data source can improve reporting. Methods Reported AEs were evaluated on two trials, Children&#39;s Oncology Group AAML03P1 and AAML0531 arm B, with identical chemotherapy regimens but with different toxicity reporting requirements. Chart review for 12 AEs for patients enrolled in AAML0531 at 14 hospitals was the gold standard. The sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV) of the AAML0531 AE report and AEs detected by review of Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) billing and microbiology data were compared with chart data. Results Select AE rates from AAML03P1 and AAML0531 arm B differed significantly and correlated with the targeted toxicities of each trial. Chart abstraction was performed on 204 patients (758 courses) on AAML0531. AE report sensitivity was &lt;50% for eight AEs, but PPV was &gt; 75% for six AEs. AE reports for viridans group streptococcal bacteremia, a targeted toxicity on AAML0531, had a sensitivity of 78.3% and PPV of 98.1%. PHIS billing data had higher sensitivity (&gt;50% for nine AEs), but lower PPV (&lt; 75% for 10 AEs). Viridans group streptococcal detection using PHIS microbiology data had high sensitivity (92.3%) and PPV (97.3%). Conclusion The current system of AE reporting for cooperative oncology group clinical trials in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia underestimates AE rates. The high sensitivity and PPV of PHIS microbiology data suggest that using external data sources may improve the accuracy of AE reporting.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,75

Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 study of temozolomide with escalating doses of veliparib in patients with relapsed, refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or AML arising from aggressive myeloid malignancies. Experimental Design: Patients received veliparib [20-200 mg once a day on day 1 and twice daily on days 4-12 in cycle 1 (days 1-8 in cycle ≥2)] and temozolomide [150-200 mg&#x2F;m2 daily on days 3-9 in cycle 1 (days 1-5 in cycle ≥2)] every 28 to 56 days. Veliparib pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [ability to inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) formation and induce H2AX phosphorylation] were assessed. Pretreatment levels of MGMT and PARP1 protein, methylation of the MGMT promoter, and integrity of the Fanconi anemia pathway were also examined. Results: Forty-eight patients were treated at seven dose levels. Dose-limiting toxicities were oral mucositis and esophagitis lasting &gt;7 days. The MTD was veliparib 150 mg twice daily with temozolomide 200 mg&#x2F;m2 daily. The complete response (CR) rate was 17% (8&#x2F;48 patients). Veliparib exposure as well as inhibition of PAR polymer formation increased dose proportionately. A veliparib-induced increase in H2AX phosphorylation in CD34+ cells was observed in responders. Three of 4 patients with MGMT promoter methylation achieved CR. Conclusions: Veliparib plus temozolomide is well tolerated, with activity in advanced AML. Further evaluation of this regimen and of treatment-induced phosphorylation of H2AX and MGMT methylation as potential response predictors appears warranted.",Clinical Cancer Research,76

SSST is very rare in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In leukemia patients, several risk factors for SSST have been reported such as administration of L-asparaginase, disseminated intravascular coagulation, congenital thrombophilia, meningeal leukemia, and intrathecal chemotherapy (IT). Lumbar puncture itself and corticosteroid administration have also been acknowledged as risk factors. We describe herein our clinical experience with SSST in a 29-year-old Japanese man suffering from AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22), who presented with abrupt onset of loss of consciousness, left hemiplegia, and seizure soon after IT and high-dose cytarabine (HD-AraC) with dexamethasone for post remission consolidation. Despite the presence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) due to SSST rupture, we conducted anticoagulant therapy with heparin. Although ICH worsened temporarily, his clinical condition gradually improved with resolution of the SSST, and he eventually became fully ambulatory. There were no deficiencies of natural anticoagulants. Three additional cycles of HD-AraC without IT therapy were conducted, but no neurological complications recurred with the concomitant use of warfarin. He was discharged free of neurological deficits. In our case, there is a possibility that IT and the administration of corticosteroids along with HD-AraC triggered SSST.",[Rinshō ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,77

OBJECTIVE To examine risk factors, mortality, length of stay, and cost associated with admission to the ICU for patients with AML. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study extracted information from the University HealthSystem Consortium database on patients 18 years or older with AML who were hospitalized for any cause between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2012. The University HealthSystem Consortium database contains demographic, clinical, and cost variables prospectively abstracted by certified coders from discharge summaries. Outcomes were analyzed using univariate and multivariable statistical techniques. Data analysis was performed from November 15, 2013, to August 15, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomeswere admission to the ICU and inpatient mortality among patients requiring ICU care. Secondary outcomes included length of stay in the ICU, total hospitalization length of stay, and cost. RESULTS Of the 43 249 patients with AML (mean [SD] age, 59.5 [16.6] years; 23 939 men and 19 310 women), 11 277 (26.1%) were admitted to the ICU. On multivariable analysis (with results reported as odds ratios [95%CIs]), independent risk factors for admission to the ICU included age younger than 80 years (1.56 [1.42-1.70]), hospitalization in the South (1.81 [1.71-1.92]), hospitalization at a low-or medium-volume hospital (1.25 [1.19-1.31]), number of comorbidities (10.64 [8.89-12.62] for 5 vs none), sepsis (4.61 [4.34-4.89]), invasive fungal infection (1.24 [1.11-1.39]), and pneumonia (1.73 [1.63-1.82]). In-hospital mortality was higher for patients requiring ICU care (4857 of 11 277 [43.1%] vs 2959 of 31 972 [9.3%]). On multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for death in patients requiring ICU care included age 60 years or older (1.16 [1.06-1.26]), nonwhite race&#x2F;ethnicity (1.18 [1.07-1.30]), hospitalization on theWest coast (1.19 [1.06-1.34]), number of comorbidities (18.76 [13.7-25.67] for 5 vs none), sepsis (2.94 [2.70-3.21]), invasive fungal infection (1.20 [1.02-1.42]), and pneumonia (1.13 [1.04-1.24]). Mean costs of hospitalization were higher for patients requiring ICU care ($83 354 vs $41 973) and increased with each comorbidity, from $50 543 for patients with no comorbidities to $124 820 for those with 5 or more comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Admission to the ICU is associated with high mortality and cost that increase proportionally with the comorbidity burden in adults with AML.

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessments have become increasingly important in oncology, aiding in identifying and informing supportive therapy needs during treatment and beyond; however, HRQoL in hematology, and AML in particular, has received relatively minor attention. The aim was to identify and summarize estimates of HRQoL in patients with AML, including patients with relapsed or refractory AML. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature published between 2004 and 2014 in the US and Europe. Abstracts from four relevant conference proceedings between 2012 and 2014 were reviewed. Data from eligible studies were extracted describing the HRQoL instruments used, domains assessed, and HRQoL scores reported. RESULTS: Fourteen peer-reviewed studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Cancer- or leukemia-specific HRQoL measures were used in 78.6% of the studies. Overall, HRQoL was superior among AML survivors compared to individuals on active treatment. Fatigue was identified as the most problematic symptom domain in patients, irrespective of their treatment status. Reported HRQoL declined shortly after diagnosis or treatment initiation and recovered over time. CONCLUSION: The included studies identified a decrease in HRQoL after treatment initiation and highlighted the role of fatigue in HRQoL in this patient population. Limited HRQoL data were identified among relapsed or refractory AML patients although they have worse prognostic outcomes. New treatment options that have less negative impact on HRQoL or health initiatives specifically targeting HRQoL of patients with AML are warranted. In addition, further studies exploring HRQoL in the relapsed or refractory patient population are needed to inform disease management and treatment decisions.",Oncology and Therapy,80

Most patients diagnosed with AML are at advanced age and present with co-morbidities, so that intensive therapy such as stem cell transplantation (SCT) is impossible to provide or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment-related mortality. Especially for these patients, it is necessary to find out whether all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate of vitamin A inducing terminal differentiation of leukaemic cell lines, added to chemotherapy confers increased benefit or harm when compared with the same chemotherapy alone. Objectives: This review aims to determine benefits and harms of ATRA in addition to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for adults with AML (not those with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (non-APL)). Search methods: We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, study registries and relevant conference proceedings up to July 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also contacted experts for unpublished data. Selection criteria: We included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus ATRA in patients with all stages of AML. We excluded trials if less than 80% of participants were adults or participants with AML, and if no subgroup data were available. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were included, if they had a refractory anaemia and more than 20% of blasts. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We used hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS; instead of the pre-planned event-free survival, as this outcome was not reported), and we calculated risk ratios (RR) for the other outcomes quality of life, on-study mortality and adverse events. We presented all measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE methods. Main results: Our search resulted in 2192 potentially relevant references, of which we included eight trials with 28 publications assessing 3998 patients. Overall, we judged the potential risk of bias of the eight included trials as moderate. Two of eight trials were published as abstracts only. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules and one trial only evaluated the effect of the hypomethylating agent decitabine, a drug know to affect epigenetics, in combination with ATRA. The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy resulted in probably little or no difference in OS compared to chemotherapy only (2985 participants; HR 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.02); moderate-certainty evidence). Based on a mortality rate at 24 months of 70% with chemotherapy alone, the mortality rate with chemotherapy plus ATRA was 68% (95% CI 65% to 71%). For DFS, complete response rate (CRR) and on-study mortality there was probably little or no difference between treatment groups (DFS: 1258 participants, HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; CRR: 3081 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09; on-study mortality: 2839 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.30, all moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials with 1428 participants reported the adverse events &#39;infection&#39; and &#39;cardiac toxicity&#39;: There was probably no, or little difference in terms of infection rate between participants receiving ATRA or not (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether ATRA decreases cardiac toxicity (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.90; P &#x3D; 0.02, very low certainty-evidence, however, cardiac toxicity was low).Rates and severity of diarrhoea and nausea&#x2F;vomiting were assessed in two trials with 337 patients and we are uncertain whether there is a difference between treatment arms (diarrhoea: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.47; nausea&#x2F;vomiting: RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.85; both very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials. Authors&#39; conclusions: We found no evidence for a difference between participants receiving ATRA in addition to chemotherapy or chemotherapy only for the outcome OS. Regarding DFS, CRR and on-study mortality, there is probably no evidence for a difference between treatment groups. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events are comparable to chemotherapy only. As quality of life has not been evaluated in any of the included trials, further research is needed to clarify the effect of ATRA on quality of life.",Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,81

Three RCTs, one each of azacitidine, decitabine, and low-dose cytarabine were identified. OS was not statistically significant and secondary outcomes including response rates, rates of transfusion independence, the frequency of hospitalizations and changes in QOL were reported differently across trials. Value-assessment tools considered OS as the primary efficacy endpoint without consideration to response rates. The NCCN Evidence Blocks TM were most successful in considering secondary endpoints.

IC and NIC as well as BSC treatment options are available; however, there is scant published literature on the impact of disease and treatment on the HRQoL in patients receiving NIC. Aim: This study determined the HRQoL among NIC AML patients. Materials and methods: Embase, Medline, Cochrane database, and conference abstracts were searched using the prespecified PICOS criteria from January 2000 to November 2017 for studies reporting HRQoL and patient preference utilities in NIC AML. Studies on patients with RAEB-t MDS, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective observational studies, and patient surveys were included, while systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used for bibliographic searching. Results: Thirteen records from 12 original studies were identified. These included five records from four RCTs, three prospective studies, four patient survey studies, and one cost-effectiveness analysis. At baseline, NIC AML patients had poor HRQoL scores especially in fatigue (33) and GHS (50) on a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health. Low baseline HRQoL scores, especially PF and fatigue (&lt;50) were shown to be significant independent predictors of poor survival. Clinical responders demonstrated meaningful improvements, especially in PF and fatigue, along with other health domains after being treated with NIC agents across several studies. Conclusion: HRQoL is poor for patients with NIC AML; measures such as fatigue and PF at baseline have been identified as independent prognostic factors for overall survival with several studies showing improvement in both domains with treatment.

Yet the contributions of respiratory adverse events (AEs) within this population are poorly understood. Furthermore, the roles of fluid overload (FO) and infection in AML pulmonary complications have been inadequately examined. Objectives: To describe the incidence, categories, and grades of respiratory AEs and to assess the associations of FO and infection on respiratory AE development in childhood AML induction. Methods: We retrospectively examined the induction courses of a cohort of de novo pediatric AML patients for any NCI CTCAE grade 2 to 5 respiratory AE, FO, and systemic&#x2F;pulmonary infection occurrence. Demographic, disease, and treatment-related data were abstracted. Descriptive, univariate, survival, and multivariable analyses were conducted. Results: Among 105 eligible subjects from 2009 to 2016, 49.5% (n &#x3D; 52) experienced 63 discrete respiratory AEs.

Longer distances to a specialized treatment center may affect patients’ access to curative-intended treatment. Especially during outpatient treatment, distance may also affect survival. Methods and patients: The authors conducted a national population-based cohort study including all AML patients diagnosed in Denmark between 2000 and 2014. We investigated effects of distance (&lt;10 kilometers [km; reference], 10-25, 25-50, 50-100, &gt;100) to the nearest specialized treatment facility on the probability of receiving intensive chemotherapy, HSCT, and achieving a complete remission (CR) using logistic regression analysis (odds ratios; ORs). For overall survival, we used Cox proportional hazards regression (hazard ratios [HRs]) and adjusted (a) for relevant baseline characteristics. Results: Of 2,992 patients (median age&#x3D;68.5 years), 53% received intensive chemotherapy and 12% received low-dose chemotherapy outpatient regimens. The median distance to a specialized treatment center was 40 km (interquartile range&#x3D;10-77 km). No impact of distance to specialized treatment centers was seen on the probability of receiving intensive chemotherapy (10-25 km, aOR&#x3D;1.1 (CI&#x3D;0.7-1.7), 25-50 km, aOR&#x3D;1.1 (CI&#x3D;0.7-1.7), 50- 100 km, aOR&#x3D;1.3 (CI&#x3D;0.9-1.9), and &gt;100 km, aOR&#x3D;1.4 [CI&#x3D;0.9-2.2]).

Relapse is caused by leukemia stem cells (LSC), the cells with self-renewal capacity. Self-renewal and proliferation are separate functions in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in steady-state conditions. If these functions are also separate functions in LSCs, then antiproliferative therapies may fail to target self-renewal, allowing for relapse. We investigated whether proliferation and self-renewal are separate functions in LSCs as they often are in HSCs. Distinct transcriptional profiles within LSCs of Mll-AF9&#x2F;NRASG12V murine AML were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing. Single-cell qPCR revealed that these genes were also differentially expressed in primary human LSCs and normal human HSPCs. A smaller subset of these genes was upregulated in LSCs relative to HSPCs; this subset of genes constitutes “LSC-specific” genes in human AML. To assess the differences between these profiles, we identified cell surface markers, CD69 and CD36, whose genes were differentially expressed between these profiles. In vivo mouse reconstitution assays resealed that only CD69High LSCs were capable of self-renewal and were poorly proliferative. In contrast, CD36High LSCs were unable to transplant leukemia but were highly proliferative. These data demonstrate that the transcriptional foundations of self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in LSCs as they often are in normal stem cells and suggest that therapeutic strategies that target self-renewal, in addition to proliferation, are critical to prevent relapse and improve survival in AML.",Cancer Research,88

Hypomethylating agents (HMA) offer an important therapeutic opportunity to a consistent number of patients, but long-term results are largely unsatisfactory.

Furthermore, the upper age limit for allogeneic stem cell transplantation is constantly increasing, so that this procedure is offered and actually given to an increasing number of older patients with AML. A literature review was conducted of the PubMed database for articles published in English as well as for abstracts from most important and recent hematology meetings on AML in older patients.

Thirty two percent (n&#x3D;199) received TBI regimens whereas 68% (n&#x3D;425) received non-TBI regimens. Five-year non-relapse mortality was higher with TBI regimens (22% vs. 11%, P&lt;0.0001) but relapse was lower (23% vs. 37%, P&lt;0.0001) compared to non-TBI regimens.

Given the complexity of high-dimensional temporal genomic data, an analytic framework guided by a robust theory is needed to interpret time-sequential changes and to predict system dynamics. Here we model temporal dynamics of the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a two-dimensional state-space representing states of health and leukemia using time-sequential bulk RNA-seq data from a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The state-transition model identified critical points that accurately predict AML development and identifies stepwise transcriptomic perturbations that drive leukemia progression. The geometry of the transcriptome state-space provided a biological interpretation of gene dynamics, aligned gene signals that are not synchronized in time across mice, and allowed quantification of gene and pathway contributions to leukemia development.

Methods: A total of 84 patients with AML and confirmed of CNSL from January 2010 to September 2019 were selected and underwent MRI scan. We retrospectively analyzed their MRI findings, summarized the imaging features of AML central infiltration, and assessed the guiding significance of MRI on diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. Results: A total of 52 patients (61.90%, 52&#x2F;84) had abnormal MRI findings, of which 31 cases clearly indicated intracranial infiltration of leukemia. Among the 31 patients, the most common site of infiltration is parenchyma (19&#x2F;31). Most MRI of these patients showed multiple lesions with low T1 signal and high T2 signal, which were more obvious on enhanced scan. Sensitivity of MRI in diagnosing AML central infiltration was 36.90%. Despite of its low sensitivity, it still had superior diagnostic value on some patients with false-negative CSF. The median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) time of patients with MRI clearly indicated central invasion were 4 and 9 months, respectively.

Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs fail to eliminate LSCs. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies eliminating LSCs are urgently needed. Our results showed that low-dose Triptolide (TPL) enhanced the anti-AML activity of Idarubicin (IDA) in vitro against LSC-like cells (CD34 + CD38- KG1αand CD34 + CD38- kasumi-1 cells) and CD34+ primary AML cells, while sparing normal cells. Inspiringly, the combination treatment with low-dose TPL and IDA was also effective against CD34 + blasts from AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation, which is an unfavorable risk factor for AML patients. Moreover, the combination of TPL and IDA induced a remarkable suppression of human leukemia growth in a xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, the enhanced effect of low dose TPL on IDA against LSCs was attributed to inhibiting DNA damage repair response.

To investigate the regulatory role of CTCF boundary in aberrant HOX gene expression and the therapeutic sensitivity of BETi in AML, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to delete 47 base pairs of the CTCF binding motif which is located between HOXA7 and HOXA9 genes (CBS7&#x2F;9) in different subtypes of AML with either MLL-rearrangement or NPM1 mutation. Our results revealed that HOXA9 is significantly downregulated in response to the CBS7&#x2F;9 deletion. Moreover, CBS7&#x2F;9 boundary deletion sensitized the BETi treatment reaction in both MOLM-13 and OCI-AML3 cells. To further examine whether BETi therapeutic sensitivity in AML is depended on the expression level of the HOXA9 gene, we overexpressed the HOXA9 in the CBS7&#x2F;9 deleted AML cell lines, which can rescue and restore the resistance to BETi treatment of the CBS7&#x2F;9 KO cells by activating MAPK signaling pathway. Deletion of CBS7&#x2F;9 specifically decreased the recruitment of BRD4 and RNA pol II to the posterior HOXA genes, in which, a transcription elongation factor ELL3 is the key factor in regulating HOXA gene transcription monitored by CBS7&#x2F;9 chromatin boundary. Thus, disruption of CBS7&#x2F;9 boundary perturbs HOXA9 transcription and regulates BETi sensitivity in AML treatment. Moreover, alteration of CTCF boundaries in the oncogene loci may provide a novel strategy to overcome the drug resistance of LSCs.

Data Sources: PubMed and relevant congress abstracts were searched using the term “glasdegib”. In addition, based on our experience with glasdegib, we considered treatment aspects of particular relevance to pharmacists and advanced practitioners. Data Summary: In a randomized phase II study, the combination of glasdegib plus LDAC demonstrated superior overall survival versus LDAC alone (hazard ratio 0.51, 80% confidence interval 0.39–0.67, p &#x3D; 0.0004). The trial reported adverse events (AEs) of special relevance for older patients, such as hematologic events, gastrointestinal toxicity, and fatigue, as well as AEs associated with Hh-pathway inhibitors (alopecia, muscle spasms, dysgeusia). Educating patients about typical AEs can facilitate adherence as well as early AE identification and proactive management. For LDAC, which is a long-established therapy in AML, various stages of delivery need consideration, with attention to individual circumstances. Practical measures such as dispensing a longer supply can reduce the number of return clinic visits, providing a meaningful difference for many patients. Conclusions: Pharmacists and advanced practitioners play important roles in treatment with glasdegib plus LDAC. Ultimately, framing plans for treatment delivery within the individual circumstances of each patient may enable them to stay on therapy longer, giving them the greatest potential to achieve benefit.",Journal of Oncology Pharmacy Practice,96

The latter targets have been particularly useful for the treatment of multiple myeloma, transforming a previously uniformly, fatal disease to one of a more chronic and potentially curable disorder. Subsequently, new treatment approaches are less likely to be based on the more classic types of cytocidal therapy, which, although successful and essential for the more aggressive disorders that are immediately life-threatening, tend to be less so, with respect to quality of life, risk versus benefit ratio and overall curability for the indolent diseases. Because the majority of newer agents are not available to the clinicians practicing in the community, a number of treatment options developed over the past two decades are capable of significantly improving the quality of life of patients with advanced CLL. The initial clinical approach to the patient should be based on performance status, age, comorbidities, and increasingly on prognostic factors elucidated over the past three decades. Initially, both simple laboratory studies and easily measurable clinical manifestations were used to guide the clinician (lymphocyte count, anemia, thrombocytopenia, enlarging lymph nodes, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly), and clinical staging systems were developed. At present a cadre of biologic factors, including cytogenetic alterations, gene expression profiles with subsequent immunoglobulin abnormalities, and expression of CD38 and Zap-70, are now available and are standard decision-making criteria to treat a patient with CLL. An initial period of observation allows the clinician along with the patient to gather all the information necessary to make an informed treatment decision. Frequently, a &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach, which for CLL does not appear to harm the patient, is the most appropriate decision. Complications of CLL, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, will lead to treatment at least temporarily in those patients who might otherwise have not needed therapy. Frontline therapy will range from easily administrable single-agents to combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Experimental protocols, utilizing &quot;post state of the art&quot; treatments, are available in the form of research protocols at major treatment centers. At the present time, it is premature to recommend bone marrow ablative therapy as initial treatment unless the prognosis appears grave and the patient can withstand the rigors of this approach. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Current Treatment Options in Oncology,101

An ELISA-based NF-κB family transcription factor activity assay was performed to quantify the κB DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts from CLL B-cells. Cell death of CLL-B cells was determined by PI staining, RelA and RelB expression at protein level of CLL B-cells by Western blot analyses.RESULTS: The expression levels of RelA, p50, RelB and p52 mRNA in CLL B-cells were all higher than that of normal B cells with statistical significance (P&lt;0.05). RelA was activated in almost all the patients detected while RelB activity was induced in part of samples. The average RelA activity in CLL B-cells was increased compared to that in normal B cells while the average RelB activity was similar to that of normal B cells. When cultured in vitro for 24, 48 and 72 hours, the frequencies of cell death of CLL B-cells from RelA⁺&#x2F;RelB⁻ group were(35.54±4.43)%,(50.92±8.44)%, and(49.24±8.16)%, respectively; that of the RelA⁺&#x2F;RelB⁺ group were (20.65±2.37)%, (18.17±1.36)%, and (26.55±4.08)%, respectively. When the cells from RelA+&#x2F;RelB⁻ group were co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs), the frequencies of cell death of CLL B-cells were decreased compared to that of the cells cultured alone, while the frequencies of cell death of RelA⁺&#x2F;RelB⁻ CLL B-cells were higher than that of CLL B-cells from RelA⁺&#x2F;RelB⁺ group when co-cultured with hBMSCs. RelA and RelB expression in CLL-B cells from the RelA⁺&#x2F;RelB⁻ group was induced after co-cultured with hBMSCs for 48 h. RelB was reduced in the cytoplasm and increased in the nucleus in CLL-B cells from the RelA+&#x2F;RelB+ group.CONCLUSION: The alternative NF-κB was indeed activated and presented heterogeneous in CLL B-cells from BM. Activation of RelB combined with RelA activity could provide the survival advantage to CLL B-cells from BM. Co-culture with hBMSCs could protect CLL-B cells through the induction of RelA and Rel B expressions.",Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi &#x3D; Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,108

Data Sources: A PubMed literature search (August 2002 to March 2014) was conducted using the terms obinutuzumab, GA101, anti-CD20 antibody, and CLL. Data were also obtained through the FDA briefing documents and American Society of Hematology abstracts. Study Selection and Data Extraction: The literature search was limited to human studies published in English. Priority was placed on trials of obinutuzumab in previously untreated CLL. Data Synthesis: Obinutuzumab is a novel glycoengineered type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, with a higher affinity for CD20 epitope, leading to superior cytotoxicity compared with rituximab. The FDA approval was based on a phase III, randomized trial of chlorambucil monotherapy (n &#x3D; 118), chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (n &#x3D; 333), or rituximab (n &#x3D;330) in previously untreated elderly CLL patients. Obinutuzumab was administered intravenously as 1000 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 for subsequent cycles. Median progression-free survival was 26.7 months in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab arm. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events in the obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil arm was as follows: neutropenia (33%), infusion-related reactions (20%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and infections (7%). Conclusion: Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil is a safe and effective new treatment option for previously untreated elderly CLL patients. It should become the new preferred therapy for these patients with significant comorbidities who are not candidates for fludarabine-based therapy. © The Author(s) 2014.",Annals of Pharmacotherapy,109

Methods: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect the p53 gene deletion in 77 patients with CLL. Presence of the deletion and its association with clinical and laboratory features as well as prognostic factors were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survivals, and the results were compared using a Log-rank test. Results: p53 gene deletion was found in 10 (12.9%) of the patients but none from the control group (P&lt;0. 05). The deletion was found in 12.5% (4&#x2F;32) of ethnic Hans and 13.3% (6&#x2F;45) of ethnic Uyghurs (P&gt;0.05). No significant different distribution of p53 gene deletion was found in regard to sex, age, ethnity, peripheral blood cell count (except for Hb) or the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, β2-micro globulin and CD38 (P&gt;0.05). The deletion rate was higher in the group with high expression of ZAP-70 and patients with advanced stage disease than that in the group of low expression and early-stage CLL (P&lt;0.05). Among 20 patients who received fludarabine therapy, the overall remission rate for those with p53 gene deletion (20%) was lower than those without (75%) (P&lt;0.05). With a median follow-up time of 39.0 (8.0-136.0) months, 11 cases had died (14.3%), among them, 7 cases died from CLL and related complications, and all of them were founded p53 gene deletion. In patients with p53 gene deletion, the progression-free survival (18 months) was shorter than those without the deletion (55 months) (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The p53 gene deletion has been found in more than 10% of patients with CLL, and the deletion rate did not significantly differ between ethnic Han and Uyghur patients. The deletion is associated with advanced stage of the disease. High-level ZAP-70 expression and the presence of p53 deletion are associated with shorter survival and poor response to fludarabine containing therapy.

We systematically searched databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase; 1997 to August 2, 2012), conference abstracts, bibliographic reference lists, recent reviews, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Primary efficacy outcomes were objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Safety end points were Grade 3&#x2F;4 toxicities, serious adverse events, withdrawals because of toxicity, and deaths due to toxicity. Studies were selected if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy or safety of relapsed or refractory CLL and if outcomes for CLL were reported separately from trials that included other lymphoid neoplasms. We used the Bucher method for conducting adjusted indirect comparisons within a meta-analysis. We identified 6 RCTs of pharmacologic treatment for relapsed&#x2F;refractory CLL. The most common drugs investigated (alone or in combination) were fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. When reported, median overall survival ranged from 27.3 to 52.9 months, and overall response rate from 58% to 82%. Although meta-analysis of efficacy results was considered, details are not presented because only 3 studies qualified and the common comparator treatment was not clinically relevant. The relatively small number of RCTs, few overlapping treatment arms, and variability in end points studied make it difficult to formally compare therapies for relapsed&#x2F;refractory CLL. Significant variability in RCT features presents a further challenge to meaningful comparisons. Additional well-designed RCTs are needed to fully understand the relative efficacy and safety of older and more recently developed therapies.","Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma and Leukemia",111

Every year, there are 15 000 new diagnoses and 5000 CLL deaths in the United States. Although therapeutic choices were once limited, treatment of this disease has vastly improved in the last decade. OBJECTIVE: Evidence-based review of the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of CLL. EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched through August 28, 2014. English-language peer-reviewed articles published between 2000-2014 were found using the keywords chronic lymphocytic leukemia, upfront therapy, upfront therapies, upfront therapeutic, upfront therapeutics, upfront treatment, front-line treatment, first-line treatment, front-line treatments, first-line treatments, front-line therapy, front-line therapies, randomized, randomized studies, randomized study, clinical trial, clinical trials, phase 3, and phase 3 clinical trial. Abstracts and presentations at scientific meetings were excluded. A total of 277 articles were retrieved, of which 24 met our predefined selection criteria; treatment recommendations were based on subsequent analysis of these 24 articles. FINDINGS: The Rai and Binet systems for staging CLL were established in 1975 and 1977, respectively. However, they do not account for new disease categories such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (peripheral blood clonal lymphocytosis that does not meet other criteria for CLL). Two subsets of CLL are now recognized based on risk stratification involving molecular and cytogenetic analyses. Outcomes are improved by the addition of immunotherapy to combination chemotherapy for initial treatment in all subsets of treated patients. Overall response rates between 75% and 90% and complete responses between 22% and 45% are expected in the current era, with more than 80% of treated patients alive at 3 years. Overall, 5-year survival has increased to 66%from 60%(P &lt; .001) in the past 10 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Chemoimmunotherapy is the standard first-line option approach for CLL, the most common leukemia observed in adults.

We applied this approach to current treatments for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Data search was conducted in PubMed and websites of regulatory agencies (year 2000 through present time). Our analysis included randomized controlled trials assessing treatments for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The endpoint of the analysis was the rate of progression-free survival at 3 years. At least two reviewers abstracted study data and outcomes. Agents examined for their relative effectiveness included four monotherapies (chlorambucil, fludarabine, bendamustine, alemtuzumab) and four combination treatments (cyclophosphamide + fludarabine, cyclophosphamide + cladribine, cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + rituximab, cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + alemtuzumab). A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to comparatively evaluate these treatments. Nine trials (3620 patients) were included in the analysis. Odds ratio (with 95 % credible intervals) was estimated for all direct and indirect comparisons. Combinations treatments were found to be significantly more effective than single-agent treatments. Ranking in effectiveness was as follows: (1) cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + rituximab, (2) alemtuzumab, (3) cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + alemtuzumab, (4) cyclophosphamide + fludarabine and (at same ranking) cyclophosphamide + cladribine, (6) fludarabine, (7) bendamustine and (8) chlorambucil. Bendamustine fared worse in our analysis than in its pivotal trial. Overall, the estimated rankings appeared to be robust according to probabilistic analysis. Numerous indirect comparisons were assessed in the absence of RCTs. In conclusion, we generated an updated synthesis of the effectiveness of these treatments and we ranked them according to a Bayesian probabilistic model. In our probabilistic analysis, cyclophosphamide + fludarabine + rituximab ranked first in the base case while the worst-case scenario of this analysis placed this treatment at a remarkable second place.",Annals of Hematology,113
CLL,"Eichhorst, B., Hallek, M.",Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Treatment concepts in transition,2015,10.1007&#x2F;s00108-014-3593-8,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the Western hemisphere and mainly affects elderly patients. No curative treatment is currently available for this disease. Treatment: Advanced disease is treated according to the patients’ fitness and comorbidity burden as well as according the presence of high risk genetic factors in CLL cells. The detection of del(17p) and&#x2F;or TP53 gene mutations reflects a very unfavorable prognosis and refractoriness to chemotherapy (very high risk CLL). In physically fit patients without high comorbidity burden and without very high risk prognostic factors, chemoimmunotherapy containing fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and the CD20 antibody rituximab (FCR) is standard therapy because this regimen has been shown to improve overall survival. In patients with significant comorbidity burden, a less intense chemoimmunotherapy regimen should be administered consisting of the alkylating agent chlorambucil plus CD20 antibody. In very high risk patients, kinase inhibitors blocking the signaling transduction pathway of the B cell receptor have been approved since 2014. The same substances are also approved in relapsed CLL. However, in relapsed CLL repetitive administration of chemoimmunotherapy is still an alternative treatment option, especially if the first remission was longer lasting (&gt; 24 months). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in very high risk CLL or early relapsed disease has become less important than in the past. In some patients considering the risk of the transplantation versus the risk of failing to respond to the new treatment option, this procedure might still be the treatment of choice in order to achieve long-lasting remissions. Conclusion: In the choice of treatment for patients with CLL, several factors must be considered. Because of the broad spectrum of treatment options, therapy within a clinical study is still the best treatment option.",Internist,114

However, the surrogacy of those endpoints for overall survival (os) is not validated in all cancer settings. In the present study, we used a trial-based approach to assess the relationship between median pfs or ttp and median os in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll). Methods The pico (population, interventions, comparators, outcomes) method was used to conduct a systematic review of the literature. The population consisted of patients with cll; the interventions and comparators were standard therapies for cll; and the outcomes were median pfs, ttp, and os. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full papers for eligibility and then extracted data from selected studies. Correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationship between median pfs or ttp and median os. Subgroup correlation analyses were also conducted according to the characteristics of the selected studies (such as line of treatment and type of treatment under investigation). Results Of the 1263 potentially relevant articles identified during the literature search, twenty-three were included. On average, median pfs or ttp was 16.0 months (standard deviation: 12.4 months) and median os was 43.5 months (standard deviation: 31.2 months). Results of the correlation analysis indicated that median pfs or ttp is highly correlated with median os (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.813; p ≤ 0.001). A significant correlation between median pfs or ttp and median os was observed in second- and subsequent-line therapies, but not in the first-line setting. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a strong correlation between median pfs or ttp and median os in previously treated cll, which reinforce the hypothesis that pfs and ttp could be adequate surrogate endpoints for os in this cancer setting.",Current Oncology,117

Data Sources: A literature search using PubMed was conducted from January 2011 through May 2015 using the terms idelalisib, GS-101, CAL-101, PI3Kδ, and CLL. Data were also obtained through the FDA briefing documents, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and American Society of Hematology abstracts. Study Selection and Data Extraction: The literature search was limited to human studies published in English. Priority was placed on trials of idelalisib in CLL. Data Synthesis: Idelalisib is a potent, first-in-class selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinaseδ (PI3Kδ) approved by the FDA in July 2014 for the treatment of relapsed CLL, in combination with rituximab, in patients for whom rituximab monotherapy would be considered appropriate due to other comorbidities. PI3Kδ is hyperactivated in B-cell malignancies and plays a vital role in the B-cell receptor pathway, a key oncogenic driver in various B-cell malignancies, including CLL. Several phase I&#x2F;II studies have demonstrated clinical activity of idelalisib in CLL, particularly in the setting of relapsed&#x2F;refractory disease, with overall response rate ranging from 70% to 82%. The FDA approval was based on a phase III, randomized trial of rituximab monotherapy (n &#x3D; 110) or idelalisib in combination with rituximab (n &#x3D; 110) in heavily, pre-treated patients (median of 3 prior therapies) with relapsed CLL. Idelalisib was administered as 150 mg orally twice daily. Idelalisib plus rituximab was associated with an overall response rate of 81% and overall survival of 91% at 12 months. The median progression-free survival was not reached in the idelalisib arm at the time of the first interim analysis. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events in the idelalisib plus rituximab arm was as follows: neutropenia (34%), thrombocytopenia (10%), anemia (5%), elevation in transaminases (5%), and diarrhea (4%).

Methods: The National Cancer Institute–sponsored Patterns of Care study was conducted among patients with CLL who were sampled from 14 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program registries. Demographics, testing, and treatment data were abstracted from medical records within 24 months of diagnosis. Results: A total of 1008 patients diagnosed in 2008 and 1367 patients diagnosed in 2014 were included. There was a significant increase in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgV H ) mutation analyses, and lymph node biopsies between 2008 and 2014. FISH testing was performed in the majority of, but not all, treated patients (53% in 2008, which increased to 62% in 2014). Some differences in the receipt of FISH testing by age and insurance status were observed over time (older patients and Medicare patients without private insurance were less likely to be tested in 2014). There were contrasting testing patterns noted by practice type and year, with nonteaching hospitals more likely to perform bone marrow biopsies in 2008, and teaching hospitals more likely to perform FISH and IgV H testing in 2014.

Despite durable responses to front-line therapy and sustained remission rates in patients with CLL, a majority of patients eventually relapse in 5 years of initial treatment. The depth of the response may affect the length of response. Maintenance therapies were aimed to deep remissions and extend the period of disease quiescence. Lenalidomide, rituximab and ofatumumab had demonstrated some efficacy as a maintenance therapy compared to no intervention for CLL patients. The relative effect on disease control and safety between different maintenance therapies were unclear. Methods We performed a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis to evaluate relative effect on disease control and safety of current available maintenance therapies.

Patients and Methods: We randomly collected the peripheral blood samples of 11 untreated CLL patients and 10 healthy volunteers, and then separated B lymphocytes from peripheral blood. Then, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western Blot were performed to detect the expression of different cytokines, including CXC-motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1). Finally, we used flow cytometry to analyze the percentage of surviving cells to figure out whether CLL cells or normal B lymphocytes underwent necroptosis. Results: 1) The high expression of CXCL-1 was seen in CLL cells compared with normal B lymphocytes (p &#x3D; 0.0001, adjusted p &#x3D;0.0012); 2) The downregulation of CXCL-1 was shown in normal B lymphocytes after induction by TNF-α and z-VAD; 3) CLL cells could restore necroptosis induced by TNF-α and z-VAD after knockdown of CXCL-1; 4) The transcriptional and translational expression of LEF-1 were downregulated after the knock-down of CXCL-1 in CLL cells; 5. 3.2μM selenite could help CLL cells restore necroptosis (p &#x3D; 0.0102) and inhibit the transcriptional and translational expression of CXCL-1.

Every year, there are 15 000 new diagnoses and 5000 CLL deaths in the United States. Although therapeutic choices were once limited, treatment of this disease has vastly improved in the last decade. OBJECTIVE: Evidence-based review of the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of CLL. EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched through August 28, 2014. English-language peer-reviewed articles published between 2000-2014 were found using the keywords chronic lymphocytic leukemia, upfront therapy, upfront therapies, upfront therapeutic, upfront therapeutics, upfront treatment, front-line treatment, first-line treatment, front-line treatments, first-line treatments, front-line therapy, front-line therapies, randomized, randomized studies, randomized study, clinical trial, clinical trials, phase 3, and phase 3 clinical trial. Abstracts and presentations at scientific meetings were excluded. A total of 277 articles were retrieved, of which 24 met our predefined selection criteria; treatment recommendations were based on subsequent analysis of these 24 articles. FINDINGS: The Rai and Binet systems for staging CLL were established in 1975 and 1977, respectively. However, they do not account for new disease categories such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (peripheral blood clonal lymphocytosis that does not meet other criteria for CLL). Two subsets of CLL are now recognized based on risk stratification involving molecular and cytogenetic analyses. Outcomes are improved by the addition of immunotherapy to combination chemotherapy for initial treatment in all subsets of treated patients. Overall response rates between 75% and 90% and complete responses between 22% and 45% are expected in the current era, with more than 80% of treated patients alive at 3 years.

The biology of CLL is entwined with its microenvironment, in which accessory cells can promote leukemia cell growth and&#x2F;or survival. Recently, much attention has been focused on the CLL B cell receptor (BCR) and on chemokine receptors that enable CLL cells to home to lymphoid tissues and to establish the leukemia microenvironment.

It is the most common form of leukemia in the western world (incidence 3-5/100 000). Elderly people are mainly affected, median age at diagnosis is around 70 years and there is a slight predominance in men. The etiology of the disease is unknown. The initial symptoms are nonspecific. Cervical lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly followed by general fatigue are seen most commonly. Other possible symptoms include night sweats, fever, loss of weight (so-called B symptoms) and frequent infections. Several patients develop autoimmune complications as autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). To confirm the diagnosis more than 5000 B-lymphocytes/µl need to be present. The expression of the typical surface markers CD5, CD19, and CD23 has to be confirmed by flow cytometry. Imaging studies as X-ray of the chest, ultrasound of the abdomen, or CT scan are used to assess the degree of lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. A bone marrow biopsy is not mandatory for the diagnosis. According to the European Binet staging system, CLL is divided into 3 stages (A, B and C). Patients in Binet stage A have 0 to 2 areas of node or organ enlargement with normal levels of hemoglobin and platelets. Binet stage B patients have 3 to 5 areas of node or organ enlargement and normal or slightly decreased levels of hemoglobin and platelets. Binet stage C patients have anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dl) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelet counts < 100 000/µl), with or without lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. As there is no survival benefit associated with early intervention, asymptomatic patients with early stage CLL (Binet stage A and B) are usually not treated but are followed on a ""watch and wait"" principle. Treatment indications include stage Binet C or signs of an active disease as rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy or organomegaly together with physical limitation, B symptoms that cannot be tolerated, rapidly deteriorating blood values, or rapidly increasing leukocyte counts. The patient's physical condition has major impact on the treatment decision. Currently immunochemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and the CD20-antibody rituximab (FCR) is the standard of care in previously untreated and physically fit CLL-patients. An alternative regimen is the combination of bendamustine and rituximab (BR). Physically compromised patients can be treated with the oral drug chlorambucil or with bendamustine with or without rituximab. Due to high morbidity and mortality, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is limited to a small group of patients and should be discussed in a high-risk situation, such as 17p deletion, lack of response to standard therapy or early relapse.

The disease typically occurs in elderly patients and has a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that impair apoptosis of clonal B-cells. Diagnosis: The diagnosis is established by blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B-lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen as well as B-cell markers. Prognosis: Two prognostic staging systems exist, the Rai and Binet staging systems, which are established by physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers also have prognostic value. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) predict resistance to most available therapies. Therapy: Patients with active or symptomatic disease or with advanced Binet or Rai stages require therapy. For physical fit patients, chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab represents the current standard therapy. For unfit patients, treatment with an anti-CD20 antibody plus a milder chemotherapy (chlorambucil) is currently established as standard treatment. At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated, if the treatment-free interval exceeds two years. If the disease relapses earlier, alternative therapies such as bendamustine alone or with rituximab, alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, or ofatumumab should be used. Patients with a del(17p) or TP53 should be considered for an allogeneic SCT. Future Challenges: Several new agents (e.g., ibrutinib, obinutuzumab) hold the potential to change standard of CLL treatment in the next 6-12 months. Therefore, CLL patients should be included into current clinical trials whenever possible. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",American Journal of Hematology,137

Herein we review the role chronic inflammation plays in the initiation and progression of CLL. The robust production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines accompanied by activation of intra-cellular pro-inflammatory pathways, and the presence of somatic mutations that activate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, suggest that chronic inflammation plays a pathophysiological role in this disease. Indeed, glucocorticoids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory possess anti-tumor activity, and glucocorticoids have been broadly used to treat CLL and its complications. Recent clinical trials demonstrated that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as ibrutinib and the immune-modulatory agent lenalidomide, induced impressive clinical responses in CLL patients with relapsed or refractory disease. As those pro-inflammatory pathway inhibitors and immune modulating drugs proved to be effective in CLL, other agents with similar activities are currently investigated in clinical trials. New insights into the pathobiology of CLL and the development of novel classes of drugs will undoubtedly provide us with effective tools to treat and perhaps cure CLL. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Critical Reviews in Oncology&#x2F;Hematology,138

In recent years, our knowledge of the molecular genetics of chronic lymphocytic leukemia has significantly broadened, offering potential new clinical implications. Mutations of TP53 and ATMadd prognostic information independently of fluorescence in situ hybridization cytogenetic stratification. In addition, next generation sequencing technologies have allowed previously unknown genomic alterations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia to be identified. Mutations of NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3 have been associated with short time to progression and survival. Each of these lesions recognizes a different distribution across different clinical phases and biological subgroups of the disease. The clinical implications of these molecular lesions are in some instances well established, such as in the case of patients with TP53 disruption, who should be considered for alternative therapies&#x2F;allogeneic stem cell transplant upfront, or in patients with ATM disruption, who are candidates to rituximab-based immunochemotherapy. On the contrary, NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3 mutations appear to have a specific significance, the clinical value of which is currently being validated, i.e. association to Richter syndrome transformation for NOTCH1 mutations, and short progression-free survival after treatment for SF3B1 mutations. Certainly, these new lesions have helped clarify the molecular bases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia aggressiveness beside TP53 disruption.

CLL has a highly varied clinical course. The substantial clinical variability in the clinical course of CLL has motivated intense efforts at identifying molecular markers that can be used for CLL prognostication. While many such markers have been proposed, few have stood the test of time; this is due to various reasons outlined in detail in this chapter. Of the reasons that have affected the usefulness and broad applicability of CLL biomarkers a few stand out as recurrent: lack of independent effects of individual markers on prognosis; the use of arbitrary cutoffs when using continuous variables; technical challenges in validity, reproducibility, and reliability (classical test characteristics); and lack of marker validation in prospectively identified CLL patient cohorts. Nonetheless, a few useful prognostic markers (CLL interphase FISH, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutation status) have been identified, and others are still in transition to widespread clinical applications (TP53 mutations, SNP array-based elevated genomic complexity). As CLL therapy transitions from genotoxic combination therapies to targeted therapies, it will be of importance to reestablish the usefulness of our current understanding of individual CLL traits in CLL prognosis. Finally, the identification of predictive markers remains important given the established associations of poor response rates with shortened survival and the ongoing need for more personalized approaches in CLL management. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology,141

Previous studies have suggested that miRNAs are extensively involved in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Aberrant expression of certain miRNAs has been observed in CLL. Associations between miRNAs and chromosomal abnormalities suggest that miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of CLL. Moreover, miRNAs may be used as novel biomarkers for the prognosis of CLL.

Engagement of surface immunoglobulin by antigen is a key driver of malignant cells with outcome influenced by the nature of the cell, the level of stimulation and the microenvironment. Analysis of surface immunoglobulin-mediated signaling in the two major disease subsets defined by IGHVmutational status reveals bifurcation of responses toward proliferation or anergy. Mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, generally of relatively good prognosis, is mainly, but not exclusively, driven towards anergy in vivo. In contrast, unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia shows less evidence for anergy in vivo retaining more responsiveness to surface immunoglobulin M-mediated signaling, possibly explaining increased tumor progression. Expression and function of surface immunoglobulin M in unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia appear rather homogeneous, but mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia exhibits a highly heterogeneous profile that may relate to further variable clinical behavior within this subset. Anergy should increase susceptibility to apoptosis but, in leukemic cells, this may be countered by overexpression of the B-cell lymphoma-2 survival protein. Maintained anergy spreads to chemokines and adhesion molecules, restraining homing and migration. However, anergy is not necessarily completely benign, being able to reverse and regenerate surface immunoglobulin M-mediated responses. A two-pronged attack on proliferative and anti-apoptotic pathways may succeed. Increased understanding of how chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells are driven to anergy or proliferation should reveal predictive biomarkers of progression and of likely response to kinase inhibitors, which could assist therapeutic decisions. © 2014 Ferrata Storti Foundation.",Haematologica,145

The complexity of CLL with respect to different chromosomal aberrations, lack of a common aberrant signaling pathway activation, and associated immune suppression of the disease has been seen a major stumbling block for developing a single targeted therapy similar to imatinib used in chronic myeloid leukemia. The upcoming therapeutic era we are entering with the B-cell receptor (BCR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib appears to be overcoming this obstacle. Indeed, for the large majority of patients, it appears that application of BCR kinase inhibitors can promote durable remissions without the need for chemotherapy.

It is the most common form of leukemia in the western world (incidence 3-5/100 000). Elderly people are mainly affected, median age at diagnosis is around 70 years and there is a slight predominance in men. The etiology of the disease is unknown. The initial symptoms are nonspecific. Cervical lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly followed by general fatigue are seen most commonly. Other possible symptoms include night sweats, fever, loss of weight (so-called B symptoms) and frequent infections. Several patients develop autoimmune complications as autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). To confirm the diagnosis more than 5000 B-lymphocytes/µl need to be present. The expression of the typical surface markers CD5, CD19, and CD23 has to be confirmed by flow cytometry. Imaging studies as X-ray of the chest, ultrasound of the abdomen, or CT scan are used to assess the degree of lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. A bone marrow biopsy is not mandatory for the diagnosis. According to the European Binet staging system, CLL is divided into 3 stages (A, B and C). Patients in Binet stage A have 0 to 2 areas of node or organ enlargement with normal levels of hemoglobin and platelets. Binet stage B patients have 3 to 5 areas of node or organ enlargement and normal or slightly decreased levels of hemoglobin and platelets. Binet stage C patients have anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dl) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelet counts < 100 000/µl), with or without lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. As there is no survival benefit associated with early intervention, asymptomatic patients with early stage CLL (Binet stage A and B) are usually not treated but are followed on a ""watch and wait"" principle. Treatment indications include stage Binet C or signs of an active disease as rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy or organomegaly together with physical limitation, B symptoms that cannot be tolerated, rapidly deteriorating blood values, or rapidly increasing leukocyte counts. The patient's physical condition has major impact on the treatment decision. Currently immunochemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and the CD20-antibody rituximab (FCR) is the standard of care in previously untreated and physically fit CLL-patients. An alternative regimen is the combination of bendamustine and rituximab (BR). Physically compromised patients can be treated with the oral drug chlorambucil or with bendamustine with or without rituximab. Due to high morbidity and mortality, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is limited to a small group of patients and should be discussed in a high-risk situation, such as 17p deletion, lack of response to standard therapy or early relapse.

Imatinib is the most common TKI modality used as a frontline therapy in CML across the world. Lately, randomized control trials have shown that second-generation TKI, such as dasatinib and nilotinib, are superior to imatinib in terms of tolerability and efficacy. Therefore, second-generation TKI have been used increasingly as a first choice for patients with CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Recently, ponatinib has shown significant efficacy against the most resistant cases (including those with T315I mutations) with CML. Omacetaxine is a non-TKI agent with a different mechanism of action and has shown benefit in resistant CML. Analysis of other novel agents and newer mechanisms affecting CML stem cells are under exploration. With these developments, the life expectancy of the majority of patients (&gt;90 %) with CML-CP has become comparable to a healthy age-matched individual. The focus has now shifted to achieving faster and deeper responses, considering these parameters as a surrogate for long-term outcome and possibly cures in patients with CML. Adherence to therapy with TKI, proper monitoring by standardized techniques, and adequate use of the available therapies are established rules of managing patients with CML. However, even with these advances, problems of drug resistance, loss of response, kinase domain mutations, transformations in CML (accelerated and blast phase), and patient noncompliance prevail in the community practice. Early identification of resistant cases, feasibility for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), and enrollment in clinical trials with newer drugs is warranted.

Although imatinib has profoundly improved outcomes for patients with CML, it has limitations. Most significantly, imatinib cannot eradicate CML primitive progenitors, which likely accounts for the high relapse rate when imatinib is discontinued. IFNα, unlike imatinib, preferentially targets CML stem cells. Early studies with IFNα in CML demonstrated its ability to induce cytogenetic remission. Moreover, a small percentage of patients treated with IFNα were able to sustain durable remissions after discontinuing therapy and were probably cured. The mechanisms by which IFNα exerts its antitumor activity in CML are not well understood; however, activation of leukemia-specific immunity may have a role. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that the combination of imatinib and IFNα is superior to either therapy alone, perhaps because of their different mechanisms of action. Nonetheless, the side effects of IFNα often impede its administration, especially in combination therapy.

The interruption of imatinib treatment is often followed by clinical relapse, suggesting a failure in the killing of residual leukaemic stem cells. There is need to identify alternative selective molecular targets for this disease and develop more effective therapeutic approaches. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is an epigenetic process that greatly diversifies the repertoire of the transcriptome. AS orchestrates interactions between various types of proteins and between proteins and nucleic acids. Changes caused by individual splicing events in the cells are small, however, &quot;splicing programs&quot; typically react to these individual changes with considerable effects in cell proliferation, cell survival, and apoptosis. Current evidence suggests a pivotal role of AS in leukemias, particularly in myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL). From these studies and studies in other malignances, it is clear that splicing abnormalities play a significant role in malignant transformation. Evaluation of AS events in CML can be used to identify novel disease markers and drugsensitive targets to overcome the limits of the small molecule inhibitors currently used for treating patients with CML. The use of aberrant splice variants as disease markers has been reported, however, little is known about the use of splicing abnormalities as drug targets in CML. Herein we discuss potential therapeutic approaches that can be used to target splicing abnormalities in CML. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",Current Cancer Drug Targets,162

Studies suggest that early molecular response (EMR) is a good indicator of a favorable prognosis and yet, to the authors&#39; knowledge, the use of EMR as a robust surrogate marker for clinical response has yet to be fully explored. EMR to therapy appears to be affected by a variety of factors, including disease characteristics, risk score, adherence to treatment, and off-target effects of the treatment. Therefore, although molecular markers improve important research, they also bring with them important questions regarding their reliability. To be useful, markers must be must be easily measureable, capable of generating meaningful data, and clinically relevant. BCR-ABL1 is the hallmark marker in chronic myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, investigators still struggle with how best to measure and interpret both high and very low BCR-ABL1 levels. Statistical models of BCR-ABL1 kinetics must address these concerns and account for the BCR-ABL1 variability between and within patients. Response models should also incorporate disease characteristics and other important parameters.",Cancer,163

In both conditions, an aberrantly activated oncoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity, namely BCRABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia, and mutant KIT, mostly KIT D816V, in systemic mastocytosis, is key to disease evolution. The appreciation of the role of such tyrosine kinases in these diseases has led to the development of improved therapies with tyrosine kinase-targeted inhibitors. However, most drugs, including new KIT D816V-blocking agents, have failed to achieve long-lasting remissions in advanced systemic mastocytosis, and there is a similar problem in chronic myeloid leukemia, where imatinib-resistant patients sometimes fail to achieve remission, even with second- or third-line BCR-ABL1 specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. During disease progression, additional signaling pathways become activated in neoplastic cells, but most converge into major downstream networks. Among these, the AKT and STAT5 pathways appear most critical and may result in drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia and systemic mastocytosis. Inhibition of phosphorylation of these targets has proven their crucial role in disease-evolution in both malignancies. Together, these observations suggest that STAT5 and AKT are key drivers of oncogenesis in drug-resistant forms of the diseases, and that targeting STAT5 and AKT might be an interesting approach in these malignancies. The present article provides an overview of our current knowledge about the critical role of AKT and STAT5 in the pathophysiology of chronic myeloid leukemia and systemic mastocytosis and on their potential value as therapeutic targets in these neoplasms. © 2014 Ferrata Storti Foundation.",Haematologica,165

The recently updated indications by the European Leukemia Network include advanced-phase CML and nonresponders to second-line TKIs. Changes in transplant programs, over the past decade, have resulted in a significant reduction in transplant related mortality and this has expanded the transplant option to older patients, who may be eligible for SCT. Transplantation for blastic phase CML remains a challenge due to the high rate of post-transplant relapses. Thus, in view of this issue, several studies of TKIs after allogeneic SCT have been undertaken with encouraging results. In conclusion, allogeneic SCT remains a therapeutic option for selected patients with CML and is currently being integrated with the use of TKIs both before and after transplantation. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",Current Cancer Drug Targets,166

Indeed, the BCR - ABL1 fusion product is a target against which many tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been proven to be effective in the treatment of CML. However, the reality is that CML patients show resistance to TKIs both in an acquired and de novo manner, and the mechanism of TKI resistance is still largely unknown. This phenomenon suggests that in addition to the BCR - ABL mutation, further genetic alterations such as copy number aberration may be involved in unexplained TKI resistance.

The development of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has dramatically revolutionized and improved CML therapy. However, TKI-based therapy faces a major challenge: the insensitivity of CML leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to TKIs. In particular, while CML progenitor cells and differentiated cells are oncogene addicted, BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is dispensable for CML LSC survival and maintenance. Notably, in CML, additional cellular mechanisms promote LSC survival and maintenance, rendering these cells able to survive even in the presence of TKI and to eventually promote relapse. Areas covered: This review will focus on the mechanisms of LSC insensitivity to TKI and on the strategies to obtain synthetic lethality with combination therapies. Expert opinion: Several pathways have been proposed to promote LSC maintenance and described as ideal targets to induce CML LSC exhaustion in combination with TKI. Ongoing clinical trials designed to target some of these pathways will assess which molecular target is relevant for in vivo human LSC survival in a new &#39;stem-cell targeting&#39; perspective. ©2014 Informa UK, Ltd.",Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy,170

Data Sources: Pertinent data were identified through a search of PubMed (January 1990-April 2013) using the primary search terms SKI-606, bosutinib, and CML. Additionally, preliminary reports published in abstract form by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and American Society of Hematology (January 1990-April 2013) were screened for inclusion. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Clinical Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies reported in English evaluating the safety and efficacy of bosutinib in patients with CML were reviewed. Data Synthesis: Bosutinib is a TKI of the breakpoint cluster region&#x2F;Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) gene approved by the Food and Drug Administration on September 4, 2012, for second-line treatment of chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast phase CML. In the second-line setting, bosutinib is effective in some patients with CML resistant or intolerant to imatinib, dasatinib, and&#x2F;or nilotinib, but it is not effective in patients whose disease expresses the T315I point mutation in BCR-ABL. Bosutinib also has been compared with imatinib, the standard first-line treatment, in 502 patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML in a Phase 3 trial. Complete cytogenetic response at 12 months, the primary efficacy end point, is similar between bosutinib and imatinib (p &#x3D; 0.601); therefore, bosutinib is not indicated in the first-line setting. Common adverse events associated with bosutinib include diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events reported in at least 5% of bosutinib-treated patients include elevated serum lipase and liver aminotransferases, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and diarrhea. Conclusions: Currently available clinical trials suggest that bosutinib is generally a safe and effective treatment option for patients with CML who have failed first-line TKIs and who do not express the T315I mutation; however, tolerability may be problematic for some patients. © 2013 SAGE Publications.",Annals of Pharmacotherapy,177

Data sources: We performed a systematic literature search in electronic databases (MEDLINE&#x2F;PreMEDLINE, EconLit, EMBASE, NHS EED, and Tuft&#39;s CEA Registry) to identify published studies evaluating CML treatment strategies using mathematical models. The search was updated in August 2013. Study selection: The models were required to compare different treatment strategies in relation to relevant clinical and patient-relevant health outcomes [e.g., life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years] over a defined time horizon and population. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: We used standardized forms for data extraction, description of study design, methodological framework, and data sources for each model. Results: We identified 18 different decision-analytic modeling studies. Of these, 17 included economic evaluations. Modeling approaches included decision trees, Markov cohort models, state-transition models with individual (Monte Carlo) simulations, and mathematical equations. Analytic time horizons ranged from 2 years to a lifetime. Treatment strategies compared included bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, conventional chemotherapy, interferon-α, and TKIs. Only one model evaluated a second-generation TKI. Most models did not report a model validation. All models conducted deterministic sensitivity analyses and four reported a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Limitations: Articles that were not published in English or German were not included in this review. Our literature search was restricted to published full-text articles in certain databases. Therefore, publications that met our inclusion criteria but were published in different databases, different languages, or as abstracts only may have been missed.

This hematologic malignancy is a unique model of oncogenesis where a single molecular hit, causing cell proliferation and survival, was identified. The chromosomal abnormality first highlighted by P. Nowell and D. Hungerford in 1960, and characterized as the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), the Philadelphia chromosome, discovered in leukemic cells, by J. Rowley in 1973. At the end of the 20th century, the contribution of molecular biology techniques was crucial by the discovery of the BCRABL1 hybrid oncogene derived from the t(9;22), responsible for the translation of an aberrant protein tyrosine kinase. This BCR-ABL1 kinase deregulates signaling pathways that control normal cell cycle and survival in primitive hematopoietic cells and is thus responsible for malignant cell accumulation observed in CML. It was then only necessary to develop a targeted treatment adapted to this molecular hit. Recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, by their specific inhibitory activity of BCR-ABL, have revolutionized the treatment of CML, allowing rates of haematological, cytogenetic and molecular responses never seen to date, and has significantly improved the overall survival and the quality of life of patients.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of CML patients with Ph chromosome positive confirmed by cytogenetic and FISH but classical e13a3(b2a2), e14a2(b3a2)and e1a2 fusion transcripts negative identified by conventional real-time quantification RT-PCR (RQ-PCR). Further RQ-PCR was done with the forward primer and reverse primer designed to detect rare atypical BCR-ABL fusion genes including e14a3 and e19a2 transcripts. Direct sequencing analysis was performed on the PCR products and mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain were detected. The clinical data of patients were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Six CML patients were found to carry t(9;22) abnormality and BCR-ABL rearrangement confirmed by FISH but classical BCR-ABL fusion genes negative detected by RQ-PCR. Further RQ-PCR and sequencing analysis confirmed the fusion of BCR exon 14 and ABL exon 3 in five CML patients (case 1-5) and the fusion of BCR exon 19 and ABL exon 2 in one CML patient (case 6). E255K and I293T IM-resistant mutations were detected in case 1 and 2, respectively. Among five cases with e14a3 transcripts, four were CML-CP, one CML-AP. Four patients were male and one was female. The median age was 48 years. The patient (case 6) with e19a2 transcripts was 40-year-old female with a diagnosis of CML-CP and PLT count was more than 1 000×10⁹&#x2F;L. Imatinib (IM) therapy was administer in case 1, 2, 3, 4 and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was undergone in case 5 after hydroxyurea (Hu) or interferon failure. Case 1 who had E255K IM resistant mutation, responded poorly to IM but obtained a complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) after a substitution of dasatinib for IM. Case 2 and 3 achieved CCyR 6 months later after IM treatment and had been maintained well with IM despite I293T mutation in case 2. Case 4 attained CCyR 3 months later after IM treatment but relapsed and died soon. Case 5 was still in CCyR after HSCT. Case 6 with e19a2 transcripts got complete hematologic response after Hu treatment and CCyR was achieved soon after IM therapy.
CONCLUSION: Incidence of CML with atypical transcripts is extremely low. They could benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors or HSCT. Rare and atypical BCR- ABL fusion gene subtypes could be missed by conventional RQ-PCR.",Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi &#x3D; Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,180

METHODS: Nested reverse transcriptasepolym erase chain reaction was performed on samples from 70 patients to amplify the ABL kinase domain. Then, the amplified product was purified and sequenced in both direction. The homologous analysis was performed in combination of clinical data.
RESULTS: The ABL domain point mutations were detected in 32 patients (45.7%) including 16 patients in chronic phase (CP), 6 patients in accelerated phase(AP)and 10 patients in blast phase (BP), which were detected as T315I, E255K, C475Y, Y253H, G321W, G250E, F317L, E258K, F359V, E459K and F311I, respectively. Sokal score with intermediate and high risk and Ph+ chromosome with complex karyotype were important risk factors for ABL domain point mutations. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was not significantly different between the patients with or without ABL domain point mutations (78.1% vs 84.2%, P&#x3D;0.985), while the 5-year cumulative event-free survival (EFS) of two groups were 34.4% and 68.4% (P&#x3D;0.034), respectively. The rate of complete cytogenetic response was higher in patients treated with allogenic hematopetic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) compared with patients merely treated with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors or chemotherapeutics (P&#x3D;0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients with ABL domain point mutations had poor efficacy and prognosis compared to those without ABL domain point mutations. Detection of ABL domain point mutations in CML-CP was helpful for the adjustment of therapeutic options and improvement of prognosis.

Research design and methods: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 681 patients with CML in Australia, Canada, and South Korea. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of chronic-phase CML, were Philadelphia chromosome and&#x2F;or BCR-ABL positive, were aged 18 years or older, and had been treated with first-line imatinib therapy between January 2005 and September 2010. Data on patient demographics, medical history (e.g., comorbidities, Sokal score), and treatment characteristics (e.g., time to initiation, therapy duration) were abstracted. Descriptive analyses were stratified by country and therapy line. Prognostic indicators of response to imatinib were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for country, patient demographics, medical history, treatment characteristics, and side effects. Main outcome measures: Hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months following initiation of each therapy line. Results: Patients&#39; average age was 57 years, and 59% were male. Overall, imatinib was initiated approximately 4 months following CML diagnosis. Complete or major molecular response (C&#x2F;MMR) at 6 months following imatinib initiation was 54% in Australia, 22% in Canada, and 38% in South Korea. At 18 months, over 60% of patients achieved C&#x2F;MMR. Approximately 30% of patients discontinued imatinib primarily due to intolerance and lack of response. Among patients who received second-line treatment, dasatinib was used more frequently than nilotinib. Multivariable regression results indicated Sokal score was identified as a prognostic indicator of response to imatinib therapy at several time points. Limitations: There are several limitations to this study. First, we selected a convenience sample of patients and physicians and therefore results may not be representative of the true population of patients with chronic-phase CML. Second, data were entered by the selected physician and could be subject to data entry errors or inaccuracies. Third, limited information was collected from the patient records, and it is possible that we did not capture additional prognostic or confounding factors related to the measured outcomes. Next, because this was an analysis of previously documented data (i.e., retrospective), we were unable to provide a priori definitions of response. Finally, multivariable analyses were limited to imatinib-related outcomes. Conclusions: Treatment patterns and prognostic indicators differed by country.

The efficacy, disease progression and safety were evaluated.
RESULTS: After treatment for 3 months, the rate of complete hematologic response(CHR) in three treatment groups were 77%, 79% and 67%, respectivily, CHR at 12 months in three treatment groups were 92%, 91% and 90%, respectively. By 3 months, the rates of complete cytogenetic response(CCyR) with dasatinib and nilotinib were higher than that with imatinib (55%, 53% vs 33%)(P&lt;0.05 for both comparisons), CCyR at 12 months in three treatment groups were 86%, 88% vs 69% (P&lt;0.05 for both comparisons). The rates of major molecular response(MMR) for dasatinib (11%) and nilotinib (9%) by 3 months were significantly higher than that for imatinib (1%) (P&lt;0.05 for both comparisons), MMR at 12 months in three treatment groups were 49%, 50% and 28%, respectively (P&lt;0.05 for both comparison). Progression to the accelerated or blast phase of CML occurred in 2 (4%) patients received dasatinib, 2 (5%) received nilotinib and 6 (8%) received imatinib.

A similar risk was also suspected with nilotinib, another BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in patients with CML. OBJECTIVE To assess the risk of vascular occlusive events in patients with CML treated by new generations of TKIs and provide an overall assessment of the clinical benefit. DATA SOURCES Two independent reviewers selected studies from PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane library database from their inception to October 21, 2014. Abstracts published during the past 3 years at international congresses and a trial register were also searched. STUDY SELECTION Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and titles against inclusion and exclusion criteria published previously in the PROSPERO 2014 protocol: CRD42014014147. Among the 249 abstracts identified, 10 studies fulfilled the established criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently extracted data using a standard form. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Information extracted included study and patients characteristics, type of intervention and data on vascular occlusive events, overall survival, and major molecular response (MMR). Themeta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95%CIs were computed using the Peto method. RESULTS Ten randomized clinical trials (3043 patients) were analyzed. Risk of vascular occlusive events was increased with dasatinib (OR, 3.86; 95%CI, 1.33-11.18), nilotinib (OR, 3.42; 95%CI, 2.07-5.63), and ponatinib (OR, 3.47; 95%CI, 1.23-9.78) compared with imatinib in patients with CML. No significant difference was found with bosutinib (OR, 2.77; 95%CI, 0.39-19.77).

However, approximately 30% of patients need to discontinue IM due to resistance or intolerance to this drug. Both resistance and intolerance have also been observed in treatment with the second-generation TKIs—dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib—and the third-generation TKI—ponatinib. The mechanisms of resistance to TKIs may be BCR-ABL1-dependent and&#x2F;or BCR-ABL1-independent. Although the role of efflux pump P-glycoprotein (Pgp), codified by the ABCB1 gene, is unquestionable in drug resistance of many neoplasms, a longstanding question exists about whether Pgp has a firm implication in TKI resistance in the clinical scenario. The goal of this review is to offer an overview of ABCB1&#x2F;Pgp expression&#x2F;activity&#x2F;polymorphisms in CML. Understanding how interactions, associations, or cooperation between Pgp and other molecules—such as inhibitor apoptosis proteins, microRNAs, or microvesicles—impact IM resistance risk may be critical in evaluating the response to TKIs in CML patients. In addition, new non-TKI compounds may be necessary in order to overcome the resistance mediated by Pgp in CML.",Molecules,187

To test whether the degradation of BCRABL1 kinase could offer improved response, we developed a series of proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) that allosterically target BCR-ABL1 protein and recruit the E3 ligase Von Hippel-Lindau, resulting in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the oncogenic fusion protein. In both human CML K562 cells and murine Ba&#x2F;F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL1, lead compound GMB-475 induced rapid proteasomal degradation and inhibition of downstream biomarkers, such as STAT5, and showed increased sensitivity compared with diastereomeric controls lacking degradation activity. Notably, GMB-475 inhibited the proliferation of certain clinically relevant BCR-ABL1 kinase domain point mutants and further sensitized Ba&#x2F; F3 BCR-ABL1 cells to inhibition by imatinib, while demonstrating no toxicity toward Ba&#x2F;F3 parental cells. Reverse phase protein array analysis suggested additional differences in levels of phosphorylated SHP2, GAB2, and SHC associated with BCR-ABL1 degradation. Importantly, GMB-475 reduced viability and increased apoptosis in primary CML CD34+ cells, with no effect on healthy CD34+ cells at identical concentrations. GMB-475 degraded BCR-ABL1 and reduced cell viability in primary CML stem cells. Together, these findings suggest that combined BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibition and protein degradation may represent a strategy to address BCR-ABL1-dependent drug resistance, and warrant further investigation into the eradication of persistent leukemic stem cells, which rely on neither the presence nor the activity of the BCR-ABL1 protein for survival. Significance: Small-molecule-induced degradation of BCR-ABL1 in CML provides an advantage over inhibition and provides insights into CML stem cell biology.</abstract>

Here we provide an estimation of the prevalence of CML in France for the year 2014 using French national health insurance data. Methods: We selected patients claiming reimbursement for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) or with hospital discharge diagnoses for CML, BCR&#x2F;ABL-positive or with full reimbursement of health care expenses for myeloid leukemia. We built an algorithm which we validated on a random sample of 100 potential CML patients by comparing the results obtained using the algorithm and the opinion of two hematologists who reviewed the patient demographics and sequence of care abstracted from claims data (internal validity). For external validity, we compared the number of incident CML patients identified using the algorithm with those recorded in French population-based cancer registries in departments covered by such a registry. Results: We identified 10 789 prevalent CML patients in 2014, corresponding to a crude prevalence rate of 16.3 per 100 000 inhabitants [95% confidence interval (CI) 16.0-16.6]: 18.5 in men [18.0-19.0] and 14.2 in women [13.8-14.6]. The crude CML prevalence was less than 1.6 per 100 000 [1.2-2.0] under age 20, increasing to a maximum of 48.2 [45.4-51.2) at ages 75-79. It varied from 10.2 to 23.8 per 100 000 across French departments. The algorithm showed high internal and external validity. Concordance rate between the algorithm and the hematologists was 96%, and the numbers of incident CML patients identified using the algorithm and the registries were 162 and 150, respectively.

Mostly diagnosed in chronic phase (CML-CP), the disease progresses without treatment to accelerated phase (CML-AP) and finally to life-limiting blastic phase (CML-BP). Contrasting the therapy of other leukemia types, CML-CP is not treated by intense chemotherapy but with oral drugs-Termed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)-for an unlimited duration. This therapy may be associated with general and developmental-specific side effects. The rarity of pediatric-CML is limiting the experience in assessment of the disability rating (DR) as an administrative health authority procedure. Methods A questionnaire was sent out evaluating the procedures and results associated with the application of a disabled person&#39;s pass.

LSCs belong to the primitive population; CD34+CD38-Lin-, which does not distinguish normal hematopoie-tic stem cells (HSC) from CML LSCs. Because Thomsen–Friedenreich&#x2F;CD176 antigen is expressed on CD34+ HSC and IL1RAP is tightly correlated to BCR-ABL expression, we sought to increase the specificity towards LSC by using additional biomarkers. Methods: We evaluated the co-expression of both antigens on CD34+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from both healthy volunteers and CML patients, using flow cytometry. Then, we used site-directed mutagenesis to induce knob-in-hole mutations in the human IgG heavy chain and the human lambda light chain to generate the bi-specific antibody (Bis-Ab) TF&#x2F;RAP that binds both antigens simultaneously. We measured comple-ment-directed cytotoxicity (CDC) in CML samples with the Bis-Ab by flow cytometry. Results: In contrast to healthy volunteers, CML samples displayed a highly significant co-expression of CD176 and IL1RAP. When either a double-positive cell line or CML samples were treated with increasing doses of Bis-Ab, increased binding and CDC was observed indicating co-operative binding of the Bis-Ab as compared to monoclonal antibodies. Discussion: These results show that the bi-specific antibody is capable of targeting IL1RAP + and CD176+ cell population among CML PBMCs, but not corresponding normal cells in CDC assay.

METHODS: A total of 100 patients with CML treated with imatinib were enrolled in this study, including 50 patients with cytogenetic relapse (study group) and 50 without cytogenetic relapse (control group) during the follow-up for 45 months. For all the patients, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of C1236T, C3435T, and G2677T&#x2F;A loci in the MDR1 gene and A6986G locus in CYP3A5 gene were genotyped and the trough levels of imatinib was measured using LC-MS&#x2F;MS.

RESULTS: The risk of cytogenetic recurrence was significantly higher in patients with CC genotypes of MDR1-C1236T and MDR1-C3435T than in those with CT + TT genotypes (P &lt; 0.05). The median survival time of the patients with TT genotypes of MDR1-C3435T and MDR1-C1236T was significantly higher than that of patients with CC genotypes and CT genotypes (P &lt; 0.05).

Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic. Results: 34 studies for a total of 54,034 Patients were selected and included in the review. Results revealed that compared to e13a2 group, the overall estimated prevalence is much higher in the e14a2 (39 % and 54 %, respectively). Besides, the overall estimated prevalence ratio of male to female was higher in the e13a2 group in comparison to e14a2 (1.08 and 0.856 respectively). The overall estimated prevalence of dual transcription of e13a2&#x2F;e14a2 was 1.11 %, and male&#x2F;female overall estimated prevalence ratio was 1.18. Conclusion: This meta-analysis of CML patients demonstrated the e14a2 as the more common transcript type. Usually, the e14a2 transcript is prevalent in females, whereas e13a2 and dual transcription of e13a2&#x2F;e14a2 are more common in men. These data explicate that the differences in proportion are not by chance. This is crucial, as the transcript type is a variable suspected to be of prognostic importance for the treatment-related response, the outcome of treatment, and the rate of treatment-free remission.",Leukemia Research,195
CML,"Peng, Yuhang, Huang, Zhenglan, Zhou, Fangzhu, Wang, Teng, Mou, Ke, Feng, Wenli, ",Effect of HSP90AB1 and CC domain interaction on Bcr-Abl protein cytoplasm localization and function in chronic myeloid leukemia cells,2021,10.1186&#x2F;s12964-021-00752-9,"Background: The fusion oncoprotein Bcr-Abl is mostly located in the cytoplasm, which causes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). After moving into the nucleus, the fusion protein can induce apoptosis of CML cells. The coiled-coil domain (CC domain) of Bcr-Abl protein plays a central role in the subcellular localization. However, how CC domain affects subcellular localization of Bcr-Abl remains unclear. Methods: Herein, the key proteins interacting with the Bcr-Abl CC domain were screened by immunoprecipitation binding mass spectrometry. The specific site of Bcr-Abl CC domain binding to target protein was predicted by Deep Viewer. Immunoprecipitation assay was used to confirmed the specific sites of protein binding. IF and western blot were used to observe the subcellular localization of target protein. Western blot was used to examine the protein changes. CCK-8, clonal formation test and FCM cycle detection were used to observe the effect of inhibitor on the proliferation ability of CML cells. FCM apoptosis detection was used to observe the level of cells apoptosis. Results: HSP90AB1 interacts with Bcr-Abl CC domain via N-terminal domain (NTD), preventing the transport of Bcr-Abl protein to the nucleus and maintaining the activation of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. The nucleus-entrapped Bcr-Abl markedly inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of CML cells by activating p73 and repressing the expression of cytoplasmic oncogenic signaling pathways mediated by Bcr-Abl. Moreover, the combination of 17AAG (Tanespimycin) with Leptomycin B (LMB) considerably decreased the proliferation of CML cells. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that it is feasible to transport Bcr-Abl into the nucleus as an alternative strategy for the treatment of CML, and targeting the NTD of HSP90AB1 to inhibit the interaction with Bcr-Abl is more accurate for the development and application of HSP90 inhibitor in the treatment of CML and other Bcr-Abl-addicted malignancies.

CML,"Qing, Yingjie, Wang, Xiangyuan, Wang, Hongzheng, Hu, Po, Li, Hui, Yu, Xiaoxuan, Zhu, Mengyuan, Wang, Zhanyu, Zhu, Yu, Xu, Jingyan, Guo, Qinglong, Hui, Hui",Pharmacologic targeting of the P-TEFb complex as a therapeutic strategy for chronic myeloid leukemia,2021,10.1186&#x2F;s12964-021-00764-5,"Background: The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) kinase activity is involved in the process of transcription. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), a core component of P-TEFb, regulates the process of transcription elongation, which is associated with differentiation and apoptosis in many cancer types. Wogonin, a natural CDK9 inhibitor isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis. This study aimed to investigate the involved molecular mechanisms of wogonin on anti- chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. Materials and methods: mRNA and protein levels were analysed by RT-qPCR and western blot. Flow cytometry was used to assess cell differentiation and apoptosis. Cell transfection, immunofluorescence analysis and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were applied to address the potential regulatory mechanism of wogonin. KU-812 cells xenograft NOD&#x2F;SCID mice model was used to assess and verify the mechanism in vivo. Results: We reported that the anti-CML effects in K562, KU-812 and primary CML cells induced by wogonin were regulated by P-TEFb complex. We also confirmed the relationship between CDK9 and erythroid differentiation via knockdown the expression of CDK9. For further study the mechanism of erythroid differentiation induced by wogonin, co-IP experiments were used to demonstrate that wogonin increased the binding between GATA-1 and FOG-1 but decreased the binding between GATA-1 and RUNX1, which were depended on P-TEFb. Also, wogonin induced apoptosis and decreased the mRNA and protein levels of MCL-1 in KU-812 cells, which is the downstream of P-TEFb. In vivo studies showed wogonin had good anti-tumor effects in KU-812 xenografts NOD&#x2F; SCID mice model and decreased the proportion of human CD45+ cells in spleens of mice. We also verified that wogonin exhibited anti-CML effects through modulating P-TEFb activity in vivo. Conclusions: Our study indicated a special mechanism involving the regulation of P-TEFb kinase activity in CML cells, providing evidences for further application of wogonin in CML clinical treatment.

CML,"Jabbour, Elias, Kantarjian, Hagop","Chronic myeloid leukemia: 2014 update on diagnosis, monitoring, and management",2014,10.1002&#x2F;ajh.23691,"Disease overview: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm with an incidence of 1-2 cases per 100,000 adults, and accounts for ∼15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. Diagnosis: CML is characterized by a balanced genetic translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson oncogene (ABL) from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11.2. This rearrangement is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a BCR-ABL fusion oncogene, which in turn translates into a Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. Frontline therapy: Three tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first-line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Clinical trials with second generation TKIs reported significantly deeper and faster responses; their impact on long-term survival remains to be determined. Salvage therapy: For patients who fail frontline therapy, second-line options include second and third generation TKIs. Although second and third generation TKIs are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, they exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as patients comorbidities, disease stage, and BCR-ABL mutational status. Patients who develop the T315I &quot;gatekeeper&quot; mutation display resistance to all currently available TKIs except ponatinib. Allogeneic transplantation remains an important therapeutic option for CML-CP who have failed at least 2 TKIs, and for all patients in advanced phase disease. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",American Journal of Hematology,198
CML,"Rea, Delphine, Rousselot, Philippe, Guilhot, Joelle, Guilhot, François, Mahon, François Xavier, ",Curing chronic myeloid leukemia,2012,10.1007&#x2F;s11899-012-0117-2,"The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeted against the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein has proven remarkably successful in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and long-term survival has become a reality. Despite this outstanding progress, detection of minimal residual disease precludes therapy termination in most TKI-receiving patients. CML has thus turned into a chronic illness, raising concerns about long-term safety, medication adherence, and health care costs. Although treatment cessation may be feasible in few selected patients achieving deep molecular responses, a definitive cure remains elusive owing to the discovery that TKIs spare quiescent leukemic stem cells (LSC). Understanding mechanisms underlying LSC behavior in TKI-treated patients may provide important clues to develop an array of strategies that ensure the complete destruction of LSC reservoirs and thereby offer CML patients a definitive cure. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Current Hematologic Malignancy Reports,199
CML,"Kimura, Shinya, Ando, Toshihiko, Kojima, Kensuke, ",Ever-advancing chronic myeloid leukemia treatment,2014,10.1007&#x2F;s10147-013-0641-7,"Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been drastically changed by the emergence of the ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib mesylate. However, resistance and intolerance have frequently been reported, particularly in patients with advanced-stage disease. Point mutations within the ABL kinase domain that interfere with imatinib binding are the most critical cause of imatinib resistance. To overcome this resistance, four second-generation ATP competitive ABL TKIs, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and bafetinib, have been developed. Dasatinib and nilotinib also demonstrated higher efficacy than imatinib in previously untreated CML patients in chronic phase. Despite promising clinical results, the frequently observed mutant T315I is not effectively targeted by any of the second-generation ABL TKIs. Thus, a third-generation ABL TKI, ponatinib, was developed to inhibit all mutated BCR-ABL and showed clinical efficacy in CML cells harbouring T315I. CML treatment is rapidly progressing and further evolution is surely expected. Moreover, it was recently reported that some CML patients who achieved sustained complete molecular response could stop TKI. CML may become the first human cancer to be conquered solely with oral medicines. © 2013 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",International Journal of Clinical Oncology,200
